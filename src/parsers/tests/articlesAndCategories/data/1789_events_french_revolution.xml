[[File:Abolition of feudalism, 4 August 1789 (Monument to the Republic) 2010-03-23 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The signing of the August Decrees — events of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] in [[bas relief]], [[Place de la République]]]]
'''The August Decrees''' were nineteen [[decree]]s made in August 1789 by the [[National Constituent Assembly]] during the [[French Revolution]].

==Background==
The [[storming of the Bastille|fall of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 was followed by a mass uproar spreading from Paris to the countryside. Noble families were attacked and many aristocratic manors were burned. Abbeys and castles were also attacked and destroyed. The peers started to emigrate to the cities of France, and incidents of brigandage multiplied by the moment. The season of ''La Grande Peur'' – the [[Great Fear]] – was characterised by social hysteria and anxiety over who was going to be the next victim. In many cases, the violence was begun not by homeless people or hunger-driven peasants but by settled countrymen who took this opportunity to further their own cause.

The Great Fear opened up the vulnerability of the French government – there was a lack of authority at the very center of it. The prolonged riots and massacres led to a general anxiety that things might get out of control, and they did. It was an experience that the country had never undergone before.

By late July 1789, as the peasant revolt reports poured into Paris from every part of the country, the Assembly decided to reform the social pattern of the country in order to pacify the outraged peasants and encourage them towards peace and harmony. The discussion continued through the night of the fourth of August, and on the morning of the fifth the Assembly abolished the [[feudal system]], and eliminated many clerical and noble rights and privileges. The August decrees were finally completed a week later.

==The Decrees==
There were nineteen decrees in all, with a revised list published on 11 August.&lt;ref name=JHRobinson&gt;{{Cite book |title=Readings in European History |last=Robinson |first=James Harvey |year=1906 |publisher=Ginn |location=Boston |pages=435ff. |isbn= |oclc=870461 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Yl4AAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=J.H.%20Robinson%20(1906).%20Readings%20in%20European%20History&amp;pg=PA435#v=onepage&amp;q=August%20Decrees&amp;f=false |accessdate=16 January 2011 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 

;Article One:The Assembly declared the feudal system abolished thereafter. Within the “existing rights and dues, both feudal and censuel (this refers to the cens, a perpetual due similar to the payments made by English [[copyhold]]ers), all those originating in or representing real or personal serfdom shall be abolished without indemnification.”&lt;ref name=&quot;JHRobinson&quot;/&gt; All other dues were redeemable, but the terms and mode of redemption was to be fixed by the Assembly. Those dues that were not removed by this decree were to be collected as usual until indemnification took place.

;Article Two: The exclusive right of ''fuies'' [allowing birds to graze] and dovecotes is abolished. The pigeons will be locked up during times determined by the communities. During these periods, they will be considered prey, and anyone will be allowed to kill them on their properties..

;Article Three: The exclusive rights of keeping unenclosed warrens were abolished as well. Every landowner shall have the rights to destroy all kinds of game in their own land. However, public safety regulations must be maintained by them. All hunting spaces, including the royal forest, and all hunting rights were similarly abolished as well. There were provisions made for the king’s hunting, however, for his personal pleasure in it. The president of the Assembly was commissioned to ask of the king the release of those people who were sent to prison or exiled for the violation of the previously existing hunting rights.

;Article Four: All the Manorial Courts were suppressed, but the judges and other officials of justice were allowed to continue with their duties until further instructions from the Assembly.

;Article Five: Any kind of [[tithe]]s, as well as any substitution for them were abolished. Whosoever possessed them,“…secular or regular congregations, by holders of benefices, members of corporations (including the Order of Malta and other religious and military orders), as well as those devoted to the maintenance of churches, those impropriated to lay persons, and those substituted for the portion congrue (this expression refers to the minimum remuneration fixed for the priests), are abolished, on condition, however, that some other method be devised to provide for the expenses of divine worship, the support of the officiating clergy, for the assistance of the poor, for repairs and rebuilding of churches and parsonages, and for the maintenance of all institutions, seminaries, schools, academies, asylums, and organizations to which the present funds are devoted.”&lt;ref name=&quot;JHRobinson&quot;/&gt; Until these provisions were made, the Assembly allowed the priests to collect the tithes. All the other tithes, which were not abolished under this law, were to be collected as usual.

;Article Six: All sorts of ground rents were redeemable at a price the Assembly fixed. No dues were to be created in the future that was irredeemable.

;Article Seven: Selling judicial and municipal offices were abolished. Justice should be dispensed freely. However, all such magistrates were to do their duty until further instructions from the Assembly.

;Article Eight: As soon as the portion congrue was increased, the fees of all parish priests and curates were abolished.

;Article Nine: Fiscal privileges in the payment of taxes were abolished forever. Taxes were to be collected from all the citizens, in exactly the same manner, and plans were to be considered to set up a new method of tax collection.

;Article Ten: All particular privileges given to certain provinces, district, cities, cantons and communes, financial or otherwise, were abolished because under the new rules, every part of France was equal.

;Article Eleven: All citizens, no matter what class or birth he might be, were eligible for any office in civil and military service.

;Article Twelve: No allowances were to be made for “…annates or for any other purpose to the court of Rome, the vice legation at Avignon, or to the nunciature at Lucerne.”&lt;ref name=&quot;JHRobinson&quot;/&gt; The clergy should apply to their bishops for financial donations and benefits, which shall be given free to any church of France.

;Article Thirteen: Various ecclesiastical dues were thereby abolished by the Assembly.

;Article Fourteen: The revenue limited to the clergies were restricted to the sum of three thousand livres. Any individual could not enjoy the benefits of several pensions at the same time, if the pensions that he already enjoyed was more than three thousand livres.

;Article Fifteen: The King and the Assembly would together consider all the reports that were to be presented with regards to pensions, favors and salaries, and would have a right to suppress or reduce that which was undeserved.

;Article Sixteen: A medal was to be struck in the memory of the important deliberations for the welfare of France, and “…a Te Deum shall be chanted in gratitude in all the parishes and the churches of France.”&lt;ref name=&quot;JHRobinson&quot;/&gt;

;Article Seventeen: [[King Louis XVI]] was proclaimed the Restorer of French Liberty.

;Article Eighteen: The Assembly was to present itself as a body before the king and submit this important set of decrees, and Te Deum was to be sung in the chapel of the king.

;Article Nineteen: As soon as possible, the Assembly was to give grave consideration to the drawing up of the laws that would be help carry out these decrees.

==The Impact of the Decrees==
The August Decrees were declared with the idea of calming the populace and encouraging them towards civility. However, the August Decrees revised itself over and over again during the next two years. [[King Louis XVI]], in a letter, on the one hand expressed deep satisfaction with “…the noble and generous demarche of the first two orders of the state…” who, according to him had “…made great sacrifices for the general reconciliation, for their patrie and for their king.” On the other hand, he went on to say that though the “…sacrifices were fine, I cannot admire it; I will never consent to the despoliation of my clergy and my nobility… I will never give my sanction to the decrees that despoil them, for then the French people one day could accuse me of injustice or weakness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Schama|title=Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution}} pp. 441–442.&lt;/ref&gt;
What Louis was concerned with was not with the loss of position of the French nobility and clergy, but with adequate reparation for this loss. Meanwhile, the August Decrees paved the way for the Assembly to make the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]].

The '''Women's Petition to the National Assembly''' was produced during the [[French Revolution]] and presented to the French National Assembly in November 1789 after [[The March on Versailles]] on 5 October 1789, proposing a decree by the National Assembly to give [[gender equality|women equality]]. There were thousands of petitions presented to the National Assembly and this one was not discussed. This petition showed how the authors were knowledgeable about the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] which had been adopted in August 1789. They provided 6 pages of women's contributions and addressed [[gender]] roles and [[slavery]].

==The petition==
The authors acknowledge how the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, with its &quot;paternal solicitude&quot;, makes it so that &quot;the poor villager is no longer obliged to grovel before the proud seigneur of his parish; the unfortunate vassal can halt in his tracks the impetuous boar that piteously ravaged his crops; the timid soldier dares to complain when he is run down by the splendid coach of the superb publican; the modest priest can sit down in ease at the table of his most illustrious and most reverend superior; . . . the black African will no longer find himself compared to a stupid animal which, goaded by the prod of a fierce driver, irrigates our furrows with his sweat and blood.&quot;

However, they were angered that women would be left out of being given rights and being able to partake in the reshaping of their country. They showed the inconsistency and hypocrisy of the Declaration: &quot;You have broken the scepter of despotism, you have pronounced the beautiful axiom [that] . . . the French are a free people. Yet still you allow thirteen million slaves shamefully to wear the irons of thirteen million despots! You have devined the true equality of rights—and you still unjustly withhold them from the sweetest and most interesting half among you!&quot;

The petition was not well received - while there were some supportive members of the National Assembly, most argued that the women were out of their place and were suffering from the hysteria of a rapidly changing society. Because of the many repeated attempts at women's equality and suffrage that failed (including the Women's Petition to the National Assembly in November of 1789), Olympe de Gouges (and many other contemporary feminists) brought feminism and the extension of ''egalité'' to women to the forefront of the debate surrounding the Revolution with documents such as the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Naish, Camille (1991). ''Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431–1933''. Routledge. p. 137. ISBN 978-0-415-05585-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposal for a decree==

&quot;The National Assembly, wishing to reform the greatest and most universal of abuses, and to repair the wrongs of a six-thousand-year-long injustice, has decreed and decrees as follows:&quot;

# Abolishment of male privilege throughout France.
# Equal liberty, advantages, rights, and honors between the sexes.
# Equal nobleness between the genders and sexes including grammatically.
# The end of clauses stating &quot;the wife is authorized by her husband&quot; because there should be equality within the household.
# Right for all to wear [[breeches]].
# End of degrading soldiers by having them wear women's clothing and instead be punished by declaring his gender neuter.
# Admittance of the feminine sex to the district and departmental assemblies and &quot;elevated to municipal responsibilities and even as deputies to the National Assembly.&quot; The consultative and deliberative voices of women.
# Appointment of the feminine sex as Magistrates. 
# The same applies to all positions, compensations, and military dignities. 
# Entrance of the feminine sex into the sanctuary.

The '''National Constituent Assembly''' ({{lang-fr|Assemblée nationale constituante}}) was formed from the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] on 9 July 1789 during the first stages of the [[French Revolution]]. It dissolved on 30 September 1791 and was succeeded by the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Leo Gershoy, ''The French Revolution and Napoleon'' (1964) pp 107-71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Estates-General===
The [[Estates-General of 1789]], made up of representatives of the three estates (clergy, aristocracy, and commoners), which had not been convoked since 1614, convened on 5 May 1789. The Estates-General reached a deadlock in its deliberations by 6 May. The representatives of the Third Estate attempted to make the whole body more effective and so met separately from 11 May as the ''Communes''. On 12 June, the ''Communes'' invited the other Estates to join them: some members of the [[Estates General (France)|First Estate]] did so the following day. On 17 June 1789, the ''Communes'' approved the motion made by [[Sieyès]] that declared themselves the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]]&lt;ref&gt;Gershoy, ''The French Revolution and Napoleon'' (1964) pp 100-107&lt;/ref&gt; by a vote of 490 to 90. The Third Estate now believed themselves to be a legitimate authority equal to that of the King. Elements of the First Estate, primarily parish priests who were closer in wealth to the Third Estate compared to the bishops who were closer in wealth to the Second Estate, joined the assembly from 13 June onwards and, on 19 June, the whole of the clergy voted to join the National Assembly. A legislative and political agenda unfolded.

===Tennis Court Oath===
[[File:Berthault - Le serment de Jeu de Paume.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Le serment de Jeu de Paume''. Copper plate by Pierre-Gabriel Berthault after a drawing by Jean-Louis Prieur (1789). The representatives swore not to depart until they had given France a new constitution.]]
{{Main|Tennis Court Oath}}
There were soon attempts by King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and the [[Estates General (France)|Second Estate]] to prevent the delegates from meeting, as well as misunderstandings on both sides about each other's intentions. Locked out of its chamber, the new assembly, led by its president [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]], was forced to relocate to a nearby tennis court, on 20 June; there, it swore the [[Tennis Court Oath]], promising &quot;not to separate, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the kingdom is established and consolidated upon solid foundations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fred Morrow Fling|author2=Helene Dresser Fling|title=Source Problems on the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=79kaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA26|year=1913|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Failing to disperse the delegates, Louis started to recognize their validity on 27 June.

The Assembly renamed itself the ''National Constituent Assembly'' on 9 July and began to function as a governing body and a constitution-drafter. However, it is common to refer to the body even after then as the &quot;National Assembly&quot; or the &quot;Constituent Assembly.&quot;

==Structure in summer 1789==
{{See also|List of members of the National Constituent Assembly of 1789}}
Following the [[storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July, the National Constituent Assembly became the effective government of France. In the words of historian [[François Mignet]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;The assembly had acquired the entire power; the corporations depended on it; the national guards obeyed it.... the royal power, though existing of right, was in a measure suspended, since it was not obeyed, and the assembly had to supply its action by its own.{{cite book |last=Mignet |first=François |date=1856 |title=History of the French Revolution from 1789 to 1814 |url= |location=France |publisher= |page=61 |isbn=}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number of the Estates-General increased significantly during the election period, but many deputies took their time arriving, some of them reaching Paris as late as 1791. According to Timothy Tackett, there were a total of 1177 deputies in the Assembly by mid-July 1789. Among them, 278 belonged to the nobility, 295 to the clergy, and 604 were representatives of the Third Estate. For the entire duration of the Assembly, a total of 1315 deputies were certified, with 330 for the clergy, 322 nobles and 663 deputies of the Third Estate. Tackett noted that the majority of the Second Estate had a military background, and the Third Estate was dominated by men of legal professions.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Tackett, ''Becoming a revolutionary: the deputies of the French National Assembly and the emergence of a revolutionary culture (1789-1790)'' (Princeton University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the leading figures of the Assembly at this time were these:

* The conservative foes of the revolution, later known as &quot;[[Right-wing politics|The Right]]&quot;:
** [[Jacques Antoine Marie de Cazalès]]&amp;nbsp;— a forthright spokesman for [[aristocracy]]
** the abbé [[Jean-Sifrein Maury]]&amp;nbsp;— a somewhat inflexible representative of the Church
* The ''[[Monarchiens]]'' (&quot;Monarchists&quot;, also called &quot;Democratic Royalists&quot;) allied with [[Jacques Necker]], inclined toward arranging France along lines similar to the [[British constitution]] model with a [[House of Lords]] and a [[House of Commons]]:
** [[Pierre Victor, baron Malouet]]
** [[Trophime-Gérard, marquis de Lally-Tollendal]]
** [[Stanislas Marie Adelaide, comte de Clermont-Tonnerre]]
** [[Jean Joseph Mounier]]
* &quot;[[Left-wing politics|The Left]]&quot; (also called &quot;National Party&quot;) was still relatively united in support of revolution and democracy, representing mainly the interests of the middle classes but strongly sympathetic to the broader range of the common people. In the early period, its most notable leaders included [[Honoré Mirabeau]], the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], and [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]] (the first two of aristocratic background). Mignet also points to [[Adrien Duport]], [[Antoine Pierre Joseph Marie Barnave]], and [[Alexander Lameth]] as leaders among the &quot;most extreme of this party&quot; in this period, leaders in taking &quot;a more advanced position than that which the revolution had [at this time] attained.&quot; Lameth's brother [[Charles Lameth|Charles]] also belonged to this group.

One must add the Abbé [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]], foremost in proposing legislation in this period, and the man who, for a time, managed to bridge the differences between those who wanted a constitutional monarchy and those who wished to move in more democratic (or even republican) directions.

== Restoration of king ==
In the summer of 1791, the National Constituent Assembly decided that the king needed to be restored to the throne if he accepted the constitution. The decision was made after the king's failed attempt to flee to Varennes. That decision enraged many Parisians into protesting, and one major protest devolved into the [[Champ de Mars Massacre]], with 12 to 50 people killed by the National Guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lafayette|last = Woodward|first = W. E.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution==
After surviving the vicissitudes of a revolutionary two years, the National Constituent Assembly dissolved itself on 30 September 1791. The following day, the [[French Constitution of 1791|Constitution of 1791]] went into effect, which granted power to the [[French Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]].

The '''Great Fear''' ({{lang-fr|la Grande Peur}}) was a general panic that occurred between 17 July and 3 August 1789 at the start of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Merriman&gt;[[John Merriman]], ''A History of Modern Europe, volume 2: From the French Revolution to the Present'' (1996), 481.&lt;/ref&gt; Rural unrest had been present in France since the worsening grain shortage of the spring, and fueled by the rumors of an aristocrat's &quot;famine plot&quot; to starve or burn out the population, peasant and town people mobilized in many regions.&lt;ref name=Merriman/&gt;

In response to rumors, fearful peasants armed themselves in self-defense and, in some areas, attacked [[manor house]]s. The content of the rumors differed from region to region&amp;mdash;in some areas it was believed that a foreign force were burning the crops in the fields while in other areas it was believed that robbers were burning buildings. Fear of the peasant revolt was a deciding factor in the decision to abolish [[feudalism]].

==Causes and course of the revolts==
{{See also|Causes of the French Revolution}}
French historian [[Georges Lefebvre]] demonstrated that revolt in the countryside can be followed in remarkable detail. The revolts had both economic and political causes, pre-dating the events in the summer of 1789. As Lefebvre commented, &quot;To get the peasant to rise and revolt, there was no need of the Great Fear, as so many historians have suggested: when the panic came he was already up and away.&quot; The rural unrest can be traced back to the spring of 1788, when a drought threatened the prospect of the coming harvest. Harvests had in fact been bad ever since the massive 1783 [[Laki]] volcanic eruption on [[Iceland]]. Storms and floods also destroyed much of the harvest during the summer, leading to a fall in seigneurial dues and defaults on leases. Frosts and snow damaged vines and wrecked chestnut and olive orchards in the south. Vagrancy became a serious problem in the countryside and in some areas, such as the [[Franche-Comté]] in late 1788, peasants had gathered to take collective actions against the seigneurs.

In early 1789, the king's financial minister [[Jacques Necker]] warned that the countryside risked a general uprising, and in April, peasant uprisings were increasingly organised and anti-seigneurial in character. Demands were made for the cancellation of harvest payments and the restoration of rights, such as that of grazing. The drawing up of the ''[[Cahiers de doléances]]'' and subsequent elections contributed to the general expectation of reform. While Lefebvre argued that fear of aristocratic conspiracy was a contributing factor in the peasant revolts, Timothy Tackett has recently demonstrated that the rumours circulating in Paris could not possibly have traveled across the countryside quickly enough to have caused the uprising. Tackett posits a fear of anarchy, rather than of aristocratic conspiracy, as the &quot;mystical multiplier&quot; which Lefebvre originally set out to uncover.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Tackett, &quot;La grande peur et le complot aristocratique sous la Revolution francaise,&quot; ''Annales historiques de la Révolution française,'' no. 335 (January–March 2004), pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Peasants began to arm themselves, ringing church bells to warn of danger, and took to attacking the symbols of the seigneurial regime, reclaiming tithes and grain.

The panic began in the Franche-Comté, spread south along the [[Rhône River|Rhône]] valley to [[Provence]], east towards the [[Alps]] and west towards the centre of France. Almost simultaneously, a panic began in [[Ruffec, Charente|Ruffec]], south of [[Poitiers]], and travelled to the [[Pyrenees]], towards [[Berry (province)|Berry]] and into the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]]. The uprising coalesced into a general 'Great Fear' as neighbouring villages mistook armed peasants for brigands. Although the main phase of the Great Fear died out by August, peasant uprisings continued well into 1790, leaving few areas of France untouched ([[Alsace]], [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] and [[Brittany]] remained largely untouched).&lt;ref&gt;Albert Goodwin, ''The French Revolution'', London, UK: Hutchinson Univ. Library, 1970 ed, 71. ISBN 0-09-105021-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Great Fear is usually associated with the peasantry, all the uprisings tended to involve all sectors of the local community, including some elite participation, such as artisans or well-to-do farmers. Often the bourgeoisie had as much to gain from the destruction of the feudal regime as the poorer peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Jones, ''The Peasantry and the French Revolution'', Cambridge, 1988, ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiliam Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'', 114-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the &quot;Great Fear&quot;, on 4 August 1789, in an effort to appease the peasants and to forestall further rural disorders, the National Assembly formally abolished the &quot;feudal regime&quot;, including seigneurial rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Merriman, a history of modern Europe from the French revolution to the present, volume 2, 1996, page 482.&lt;/ref&gt; This in effect led to the general unrest of the nobility of France.

===Ergotism===
Historian Mary K. Matossian argued that one of the causes of the Great Fear was consumption of [[ergot]], a [[hallucinogen]]ic fungus. In years of good harvests, wheat with ergot was thrown away, but when the harvest was poor, the peasants could not afford to be so choosy.&lt;ref&gt;Matossian, Mary Kilbourne, ''Poisons of the Past: Molds, Epidemics, and History''. New Haven: Yale, 1989 (reedited in 1991) ISBN 0-300-05121-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to previous peasant revolts==
Peasant revolt was clearly not a new phenomenon in late eighteenth-century France: the fourteenth century saw the [[Jacquerie]] in the Oise Valley, and the seventeenth century saw the [[Croquant rebellions]]. [[Yves-Marie Bercé]], in History of the Peasant Revolts, concludes &quot;peasant revolts of the years 1789–92 had much in common with their seventeenth-century counterparts: unanimity of the rural community, rejection of new taxation to which they were unaccustomed, defiance of enemy townsmen and a belief that there would be a general remission in taxes, particularly when the king decided to convene the estates general. In spite of all that is suggested by the political history of the period, the peasant disturbances at the beginning of the French Revolution did not depart from the typical community revolt of the preceding century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yves-Marie Bercé]], ''History of the Peasant Revolts'' (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1990), 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual cause of communal violence was “an assault launched from outside upon the community as a whole” whether that outsider be those profiting from unfairly high bread prices, maurading bandits, witches or magistrates abusing power.&lt;ref&gt;Bercé, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement about sixteenth- and seventeenth-century uprisings appears, at first, to apply equally to the Great Fear of 1789. However, a distinctive aspect of the latter was an ambiguous outsider at the outset of disturbance. Whether the brigands were English, Piedmontese or merely vagabonds was not easily determined and, when the Great Fear had spread to its largest expanse, it was a system, feudalism, rather than a specific person or group, at which its animosity was directed. Earlier revolts had not been subversive, but rather looked to a golden age that they wished to be reinstated; the socio-political system was implicitly validated by a critique of recent changes in favour of tradition and custom.&lt;ref&gt;Bercé, 332.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Cahiers des doléances'' had opened the door to the people’s opinion directly affecting social circumstances and policy and the Great Fear evidences this change.

The most glaring difference between the Great Fear of 1789 and previous peasant revolts is its scope. Spreading from a half-dozen or so separate nuclei across the countryside, almost all of France found itself in rural uproar. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, revolt was almost always contained within the borders of a single province.&lt;ref&gt;Bercé, 322.&lt;/ref&gt; This change in magnitude reflects to what extent social discontent was with the entire governmental system (and its ineffectiveness) rather than with anything particular to a locality. While the specific manifestation of the fear of brigands (who they were, what they were most likely to attack) may have been contingent upon local contexts, as Tackett argues, nevertheless, that the brigands were perceived as a genuine threat to the peasants across the country in a wide-variety of local contexts speaks to a more systemic disorder.

Comparing the peasant revolts of the Tard Avisés with the Great Fear of 1789 demonstrates some key similarities and differences. From 1593–1595, in Limousin and Périgord, groups of peasants rose up against armed forces that occupied the countryside and raised funds by levying taxes and ransom. In a series of assemblies, the [[Croquants]], as they were derogatively called, worked on a military plan for action and successfully expelled the garrisons from their lands. The letters between these assemblies justified their armed resistance as opposition to unjust claims on their property. When the chaotic political situation was stabilized with the coronation of Henry IV, the revolts ended and the peasants were eventually accorded the tax rebate they had demanded earlier. The Tard-Avisés had specific goals and achieved them; the same cannot be said of the participants in the Great Fear.

The Great Fear of 1789 broke with another pattern typical of peasant revolts in earlier centuries. The panic lasted for more than a few weeks and during the most labour-intensive months of the year. The Tard-Avisés and other revolts of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-centuries occurred during the Spring months when the peasants had spare time. The panic of brigands destroying the harvest was so great in 1789 that peasants actually forwent working on the harvest in late June and July. The pragmatism of the previous revolts, which had produced real results, had disappeared by the end of the Ancien Régime.

Communal violence was but one tactic out of many for opposing an enemy and the peasants of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-centuries, drawing on a heritage of communal justice, might rise up to prevent enclosement of a communal grazing space, like a marsh, to demand lower bread prices, or to evade their taxes. During the reign of [[Louis XIV]], however, popular revolt became less and less of a viable option for reform as the state became better able to respond to insurgency and addressed many of the issues at the heart of peasant revolt. Reforms in the military structure prevented French soldiers from plundering French soil and armed conflict with other powers was not fought at home. Thus, the threat of roaming bandits was a particularly poignant one – it evoked an era of lawlessness which the French monarchy had successfully countered in previous years.

There was much in common between the Peasantry in the Great Fear of 1789 and the peasants of the revolts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but they were not unmalleable nor unchanged by the experience of Bourbon rule and its subsequent dissolution. Without the monarchy or a replacement government to administer and protect the people, the harvest, and with it, life itself, was in grave danger.

The '''Revolution Controversy''' was a British debate over the [[French Revolution]], lasting from 1789 through 1795.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butt, Introduction, 1&quot;&gt;Butt, &quot;Introduction&quot;, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A pamphlet war began in earnest after the publication of [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), which surprisingly supported the French aristocracy. Because he had supported the American colonists in their [[American Revolution|rebellion against England]], his views sent a shock-wave through the country. Many writers responded, defending the revolution in France, among them [[Thomas Paine]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and [[William Godwin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Butt, Introduction, 1&quot;/&gt; Alfred Cobban calls the debate that erupted &quot;perhaps the last real discussion of the fundamentals of politics&quot; in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Butler, &quot;Introduction&quot;, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The themes articulated by those responding to Burke would become a central feature of the radical working-class movement in Britain in the nineteenth century and of [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler, Introduction, 1&quot;&gt;Butler, &quot;Introduction&quot;, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Britons celebrated the [[storming of the Bastille]] in 1789, believing that France's monarchy should be curtailed by a more democratic form of government. However, by December 1795, after the [[Reign of Terror]] and war with France, there were few who still supported the French cause.

==Burke's ''Thoughts''==
Responding in part to a sermon defending the French Revolution given by the [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] clergyman [[Richard Price]] entitled ''[[A Discourse on the Love of our Country]]'' (1789), Edmund Burke published his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' in an effort to advance arguments for the current aristocratic government. Because Burke had previously been part of the liberal [[British Whig Party|Whig]] party, a critic of monarchical power, a supporter of the [[American revolution]]aries, and a critic of government graft in India, most in Britain expected him to support the French revolutionaries. When he failed to do so, it shocked the populace and angered his friends and supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 33; Kelly, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's book sold 30,000 copies in two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler, 35&quot;&gt;Butler, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Reflections'' defended &quot;the aristocratic concepts of paternalism, loyalty, chivalry, the hereditary principle&quot; and property.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler, 35&quot;/&gt;

Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; While the radicals saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) in which [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government, contending that citizens do not have the right to overthrow their government. Civilizations and governments, he maintained, are the result of social and political consensus; their traditions cannot be challenged—the result would be anarchy.

==Responses==

Liberals such as [[William Godwin]], [[Thomas Paine]], and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] argued for [[republicanism]], [[agrarian socialism]], and [[anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those who came to be called radicals emphasized the same themes: &quot;a sense of personal liberty and autonomy&quot;; &quot;a belief in civic virtue&quot;; &quot;a hatred of corruption&quot;; an opposition to war because it only profited the &quot;landed interest&quot;; a critique of the monarchy and the aristocracy and its perceived desire to draw power away from the [[House of Commons of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their works were published by [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], who was eventually jailed for his seditious activities.

Wollstonecraft had been much influenced by the ideas she ingested from Price's sermons at [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] and the whole ethos of [[English Dissenters|Rational Dissent]] in the village of [[Newington Green]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p51 passim.&lt;/ref&gt; These seeds germinated into ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'', her response to Burke's denunciation of her mentor. Paine, one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] argued in ''[[Rights of Man]]'' that popular political revolution is permissible when a government does not safeguard its people, their natural rights, and their national interests.

This Controversy left further legacies. Wollstonecraft's most famous work, ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' was written in 1792, in the spirit of rationalism extending Price's arguments about equality to women. [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]], a prolific writer admired by [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[William Wordsworth]] and wife of the minister at [[Newington Green]], alluded to Burke's work and his opponents in her &quot;Sins of the Government, Sins of the Nation&quot; (1793).

The '''Society of the Friends of the Blacks''' ({{lang-fr|Société des amis des Noirs'' or ''Amis des noirs}}) was a group of French men and women, mostly [[White (people)|white]], who were [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionists]] (opponents of [[Black (people)|black]] [[slavery]] and the [[African slave trade]]). The Society was created in Paris in 1788, and remained in existence until 1793. It was led by [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]], with advice from [[Thomas Clarkson]], who headed the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] movement in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. At the beginning of 1789, it had 141 members.

During the five-year period of its existence, it published anti-slavery literature and addressed its concerns on a substantive political level in the [[National Assembly of France]]. Ironically, however, any real, practical legislative mitigation of the slaves' plight would emerge only after the demise of the Society in 1793. In February 1794, the National Assembly legislated the Universal Emancipation decree, which effectively freed all colonial slaves.

Several articles and [[monograph]]s have explored the question of how influential the Society was in bringing about the abolition of slavery with opinions covering the entire spectrum, from those that identify the Amis des Noirs as instrumental in the abolition of slavery, to others that say the Society was nothing more than a &quot;société de pensée&quot; (philosophical society).&lt;ref name=&quot;Resnick_562&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Resnick|1972|p=562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[economy of France]] was dependent upon revenues from the [[French colonies|colonies]], where [[slavery]] existed on [[plantations]] and thrived due to the lucrative [[triangular trade|trade triangle]]. Figures indicate that slave-trade activity during the years leading up to the [[French Revolution]] resulted in some profit percentages exceeding 100 percent. In 1784, for example, the outfitter Chaurands realized a profit of 110 percent through the use of a single ship, the ''Brune''. In 1789, one outfitter reached 120 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stein|1975|p=782}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This is further corroborated by Atlantic slave ship tonnage statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Viles|1972|pp=530–531}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The initial formation of La Société des Amis des Noirs was undertaken by [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]], in February 1788. A follower of the [[Philosophes]], Brissot's anti-slavery efforts were also due to his exposure to humanitarian activities on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. In the United States, where he visited [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia's]] [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]], he became absorbed with [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson's]] humanitarian nature. In England, [[Thomas Clarkson]] invited Brissot to attend a meeting of the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]]. So enthused was Brissot that shortly thereafter he would create his own abolitionist society in Paris. Its objectives would be to suppress the slave trade and, at a later date, to attain equal rights for free men of color.

The ''Amis'' advocated freedom in the [[French colonial empire|French colonies]], arguing that the ideas of the Revolution should extend to the colonies. The French concept of ''{{lang|fr|[[liberté, égalité, fraternité]]}}'' did not include the liberation of slaves, because the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] argued that the abolition would be detrimental to the economy. The Amis des Noirs had, as was made clear by [[Marquis de Condorcet]]'s program, the abolition of slavery as its immediate goal – and campaigned for it despite calls Clarkson's call for reducing their demands to activism against the slave trade only.

==Activities==

===Abolitionist literature===
The Society's founder, Brissot, decided at the outset that the method of spreading the society's message would be through literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Seeber|1937|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this he did in profusion. The Society emitted not only French translation of the English literature, but also works written by Brissot (&quot;Mémoire sur les Noirs de l'Amerique septentrionale&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brissot|1789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and other members of the Amis des Noirs, such as [[Étienne Clavière]] (&quot;De la France et des Etats-Unis&quot; – co-written with Brissot&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Seeber|1937|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Condorcet (&quot;Réflexions sur l'esclavage des negres&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Condorcet|1788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''6''', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;). Addresses were delivered to other societies as well, such as the Amis de l'humanité,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1790b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''8''', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Société des Amis de la Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brissot|1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''8, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a reflection of not only the &quot;Philosophe upbringing&quot; of the Society members, but also of their efforts to be active participants in the moulding of the revolutionary government.

La Société des Amis des Noirs was most active dispersing its anti-slavery literature in and around Paris, due to the lack of a stable and reliable communications network. The Society, nevertheless, did make attempts to convey its message to those living outside Paris. Quinney reveals one instance, during 1791, when the organization had garnered assistance from its [[Jacobin]] friends: &quot;The Friends of the Blacks had several meetings with their friends in Jacobin clubs in provincial cities and sent to every city government a lengthy pamphlet exposing the injustices done to people of colour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970b|p=555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political activities===

The political activities of the Friends of the Blacks also included addresses to the National Assembly. Addresses promoting the abolition of the slave trade were made in February and April 1790.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1790a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another address was delivered a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brissot|1790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''7''', p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; Four months later, a discourse was presented concerning the violence in Saint Domingue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1790c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''8''', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1791, Clavière addressed the National Assembly's commercial interests, discussing trade relations between France and its colonies.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A toutes les Villes de Commerce, a toutes les Manufactures, aux Colonies, a toutes les Sociétés des Amis de la Constitution; Addresse dans laquelle on approfondit les relations politiques et commerciales entre la Métropole et les Colonies, etc.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''9''', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society also addressed government individuals such as [[Antoine Barnave|Barnave]], who was a member of the Committee on Colonies, and [[Jacques Necker]], France's Controller-General Of Finance. Although Necker was a believer in the in-humaneness of slavery, he could not sanction emancipation unless the practice of slavery and the slave trade were halted simultaneously in every country. In this manner, the existing economic balance between nations would be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lokke|1968|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in a letter written in 1789 the Society urged Necker to form a committee similar to the one in England and expressed hopes that the conduct of the English parliament might have a positive effect on the Estates-General.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1789c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''7''', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Society addresses extended to denunciations of colonial individuals. One such incident occurred in 1791, when the Amis des Noirs responded to criticisms written by pro-slaver [[Arthur Dillon (1750–1794)|Arthur Dillon]], Député de la Martinique,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;La Société des Amis des Noirs a Arthur Dillon, Député de la Martinique a l'Assemblée Nationale&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''8''', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; and owner of a large plantation.

In 1789, the royal government had requested petitions of grievances from all parts of the country. During the election of representatives to the Estates-General, Condorcet asked that there be inserted into the [[cahiers de doléances]] a demand for the abolition of the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cahen|1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the six hundred cahiers assembled, less than fifty called for an end to the slave trade and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McCloy|1954|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1789, Society member [[Henri Grégoire|Abbé Grégoire]]'s recommendation that two deputies chosen from the population of free coloured men be admitted&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Garrett|1916|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; was accepted by the Committee on Verification of Credentials in the National Assembly. He was unable to present the recommendation to the National Assembly because every time he rose to speak, he was shouted down by the colonists in the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Necheles|1971|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1790, Grégoire questioned the article on voting rights in the National Assembly, wishing to ensure that men of colour also received the right to vote. The colonial deputies persuaded the National Assembly to close discussion of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970a|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that same month Barnave, a pro-slavery advocate, delivered his report on maintaining the slave trade. When Mirabeau, another member of the Society, advanced to the rostrum to protest, he was drowned out by the cries of the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970a|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing on the rights of free men of colour, Grégoire and [[Alexandre Pétion]] (another member of the Society) essentially told the Assembly on 15 May 1791 that if these people were not given their rights, then violence would ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970b|p=550}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the increasing conflict in the colonies, as well as the growing influence of free men of colour with some deputies, Barnave felt that the members of the Society could not be ignored: &quot;We can't win against the influence of the Friends of the Blacks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970b|p=553}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the 15 May decree that all men of colour would be granted equal rights if they were born of free parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cochin|1979|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further legislation passed on 4 April 1792 (with influence from La Société des Amis des Noirs), stating that every free man of colour now enjoyed equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gaston-Martin|1948|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition from pro-slavery groups==

===The Committee on Colonies===
The Committee on Colonies was formed in March 1790 to deal with escalating problems arising from slavery unrest in the colonies. Its resolution of the problem leaned heavily in favour of the colonists, and its membership was permeated by those who bore little sympathy for the plight of the slave. The members of the committee included colonial landowners, slave owners, lawyers and merchants, and all were advocates of French commercial interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970b|p=545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, the final report of the Committee did not alleviate any of the problems relating to slavery. In fact, it stressed the point that it did not wish to interfere in the commercial interests of the colonies: &quot;The National Assembly declares that it had not intended to innovate in any branch of commerce direct or indirect of France with its colonies...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Quinney, V p. 547&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970b|p=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of National Assembly deputies who were either colonists or slave trade merchants actively campaigned the French chambers of commerce and city governments to maintain the slave trade and slavery, proclaiming that economic disaster would result from its abolition. The deputies argued their point so effectively that even La Société des Amis des Noirs feared abolition would cause chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970b|p=549}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such pro-slavery group was composed of the lobbyists for the French chambers of commerce, who designated themselves as the &quot;Deputies Extraordinary of Manufactures and Commerce.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Quinney, V p. 548&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970b|p=548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their main efforts focused on influencing the Committee on Agriculture and Commerce to maintain slavery and the slave trade. Since revenue from the colonies was collected mainly from the sale of slaves and crops, the Committee was investigating the economic ramifications should this source of income cease to exist. The lobbyists were evidently successful in their efforts, for Quinney claims that Barnave's non-committal report to the National Assembly was a result of his knowledge that the Committee on Agriculture and Commerce &quot;had already decided to advise the National Assembly to retain the trade and slavery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Quinney, V p. 547&quot;/&gt;

===The Massiac Club===
A pro-slavery organization called the Massiac Club, headquartered in Paris, was composed of colonial planters living in Paris and throughout France. The club had its main headquarters in Paris, with chapters located in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McCloy|1961|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that success related to political influence, the club proceeded to systematically contact government officials.{{efn|&quot;Le club, en fait, forme avant tout un lobby. Il n'a pas de représentant en tant que tel B l'Assemblée nationale mais joue sur l'influence de certains élus, en tLte desquels l'avocat grenoblais Barnave, membre des Jacobins.&quot; Biondi, J.P. – Zuccarelli, F. 16 Pluviose An II, p. 42}}

The Massiac members did not wish to risk the possibility of any type of abolition legislation being passed, and communicated with every colonial deputy to ensure that pro-slavery interests were maintained. [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] stated that when he attempted to sway the deputies in favour of abolition, every official he spoke to had already been approached by a member of the Massiac club.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quinney, V p. 548&quot;/&gt; Like the Amis des Noirs, the Massiac group published and distributed literature, responding ''in toto''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hazard|1873|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; to practically every idea the Amis des Noirs had put forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vidalenc|1957|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the Massiac Club delivered accusations in a leaflet distributed to the members of the Comité de Commerce de l'Assemblée Nationale that the Amis des Noirs were involved in subversive activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Resnick|1972|p=564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To discredit the Amis des Noirs, the Massiac Club published a handbill that said the abolitionists were not truly humanitarian philanthropists, but rather an organization attempting to subvert social order. They claimed the Amis des Noirs should be viewed as counter-revolutionaries, and pro-British.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen_139&quot;/&gt; The pro-slavers also distributed leaflets denouncing individual members of the Société: Brissot, Grégoire and Pétion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Benot|1988|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; They supported the slave trade in debates held in district assemblies within Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970a|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to influence voting in these districts when the question of the slave trade was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970a|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Organisational failings===
Researchers conclude that the Society was virtually impotent due to its organization, strategy, and membership criteria. In terms of organization, Quinney refers to the group's ineffective operations, stating that the government, which contained pro-slavery elements, had a nationwide propaganda network, while the Society was mainly Paris-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970a|pp=124, 126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resnick concurs when he states: &quot;Both leadership and membership at large were drawn heavily from the Paris area, with no established network of regional filiations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Resnick_562&quot;/&gt;

Additional evidence of this deficiency was seen in the irregular holding of meetings, without full membership present. Even in 1789, Thomas Clarkson commented upon the poor attendance the meetings were receiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Clarkson|1808|pp=381–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of organization and continuity among the Society's activities is further evidenced by the fact that Brissot, though inaugurating the Society's first meeting in February 1789, was to depart for America&lt;ref name=&quot;Perroud_124&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Perroud|1916|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; four months later, to meet that country's leading abolitionists. He was not active within the Society until the spring of 1790,&lt;ref name=&quot;Perroud_124&quot;/&gt; when he again became the Society's president. Brissot was able to become eligible upon his return from America, due to a regulation of the Society that the organization must have rotating presidents every three months, a condition that would hinder the continuity of effort within the organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;reglemens&quot;&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1789a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''6''', pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Another structural hindrance was a regulation that an inner &quot;General Assembly&quot; would be elected within the Society. This body would not only represent the Society and make the rules, but would also hold exclusive voting rights in the election of the officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;reglemens&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''6''', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, from the organization's inception, any rank and file membership would be excluded from participating in the Society's operations.

===Elitist membership policies===
Examination of the membership list of the Society reveals that there are an overwhelming number of privileged names. Although possessing great influence, the effectiveness of these people would be muted and Paris-based, partially due to a lack of popular participation. The founding members of the Society included such notables as Brissot, Condorcet, [[Jean François de Saint-Lambert|Saint-Lambert]], Lafayette, [[Dominique de La Rochefoucauld|La Rochefoucauld]], and Clavière.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Benot|1988|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society began with a handful of abolitionists, increased to ninety-five by 1789, and would swell to a maximum of 141&lt;ref name=&quot;Perroud_144&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Perroud|1916|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; associates in later years. An analysis of membership lists published seventy-five years ago shows that out of the 141 members, twenty-five percent were government employees, twenty-nine percent were nobility, and thirty-eight were professionals, thus bringing the cumulative sum of the elitist membership to ninety-two percent of the total.&lt;ref&gt;There were two sources used to accumulate the names of the members: Tableau des Membres de la Société des Amis des Noirs. Année 1789 – S.I. (Paris), s.d. (1789) and {{harvp|Perroud|1916}} (A list of members is presented at the end of this article.)&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen has observed this fact as well, stating: &quot;It [the Society]... concentrated on having important, well-connected members, rather than large members&amp;nbsp;... The members [were] drawn from the French social elite&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen_139&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Cohen|1980|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small member base of the agency was elitist-oriented, but another reason for the lack of a &quot;grass-roots&quot; following was the organization's insistence on having dues payable, and four reference signatures, to become a member. Moreover, there were different fee scales: two Louis per year for those who lived in Paris, and 24 livres per year for those living in the provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;reglemens&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#revol|''La Révolution française et l'abolition de l'esclavage'' (1968)]] '''6''', pp.&amp;nbsp;19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Undoubtedly, the membership practices of La Société des Amis des Noirs both hampered its attempt at increasing in size, and affected its ability to become a credible and effective entity. These prerequisites to membership, along with a weak structural foundation and somewhat ill-prepared organization, compromised La Société des Amis des Noirs' contribution to the fight against slavery.

===Relationship to English abolitionists===
Perroud states that Brissot's trip to London in November 1787 prompted him to form an identical chapter in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Perroud|1916|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English society had only been formed a few months earlier, in May 1787.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen_139&quot;/&gt; Just how much influence London really had is revealed in a discussion amongst a group of abolitionist friends in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1788|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states how the London society encouraged others to join its cause, as well as mentioning that France and England had a commonality&lt;ref name=&quot;Londres, a l 1788, p. 16&quot;&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1788|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with respect to abolishing slavery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Londres, a l 1788, p. 16&quot;/&gt;

Adherence to the English abolitionist movement also included the translation and publication of English anti-slavery literature. This is evidenced in a letter written by Brissot, shortly after the creation of the Society, to [[Quaker]] James Philips, an original member of the English abolitionist society. In it he states that the Amis des Noirs would translate and publish English anti-slavery works for distribution to the French public.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Seeber|1937|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of using English publications surfaced even before the formation of the Amis des Noirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1788|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many French citizens believed that the Society was an offshoot of the English abolitionist society, to the point of being paid by its English counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Quinney|1970a|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a loss of credibility in the eyes of the French populace. Britain and France had been antagonistic towards each other for many years, in terms of colonial acquisitions and economic superiority. Therefore, any influences from England were seen as &quot;dealing with the enemy.&quot; This view extended to encompass the activities of the Society. The perception that it was a vehicle for English infiltration into French matters overshadowed its real intentions.

==Outcome==
The Society was rendered inactive by the outbreak of the [[Haitian Revolution]], begun as a [[slave rebellion]], as well as by the major crisis of the [[First French Republic]] (with the start of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]). It remained active until 1793, publishing its calls in papers such as ''Patriote français'', ''L'Analyse des papiers anglais'', ''Le Courrier de Provence'', and ''La chronique de Paris''.

On 4 February 1794 (16 [[Pluviôse]] an II), approximately a year after the demise of the Amis des Noirs, the National Convention passed the Emancipation Declaration:

::''{{lang|fr|La Convention Nationale déclare que l'Esclavage des Negres dans toutes les Colonies est aboli: en conséquence elle décrete que tous les hommes, sans distinction de couleur, domiciliés dans les colonies, sont Citoyens Français, et jouiront de tous les droits assurés par la Constitution. Elle renvoie au comité de salut public, pour lui faire incessamment un rapport sur les mesures a prendre pour assurer l'exécution du présent décret.}}'' [The National Convention declares that slavery of Negroes in all the Colonies is abolished; consequently it decrees that all men, without distinction of color, domiciled in the colonies are French citizens, and shall enjoy all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution . It refers to the public salvation committee, to make it incessantly report on measures taken to ensure the implementation of this Decree].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|La Société des Amis des Noirs|1794|pp=320–323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Couder Stati generali.jpg||thumb|350px|Painting by [[Auguste Couder]] showing the opening of the Estates-General]]
The '''Estates-General''' (or '''States-General''') '''of 1789''' ({{lang-fr|Les États-Généraux de 1789}}) was the first meeting since 1614 of the French [[Estates General (France)|Estates-General]], a general assembly representing the French [[estates of the realm]]: the clergy (First Estate), the nobles (Second Estate), and the common people (Third Estate). Summoned by [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] to propose solutions to his government's financial problems, the Estates-General sat for several weeks in May and June 1789 but came to an impasse over the first item on the agenda: whether they should vote by estate, giving the first two estates an advantage, which was the King's choice, or vote all together, giving the Third Estate the advantage. It was brought to an end when the Third Estate formed into a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], inviting the other two to join, against the wishes of the King, signaling the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]].

== The decision to summon the Estates ==

=== First Assembly of Notables and peasants ===
The suggestion to summon the Estates General came from the [[Assembly of Notables]] installed by the King on 22 February 1787. It had not met since 1614. The usual business of registering the King's edicts as law was performed by the [[Parlement of Paris]]. In this year it was refusing to cooperate with [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]]'s programme of badly needed financial reform, due to the special interests of its noble members. Calonne was the Controller-General of Finances, appointed by the King to address the state deficit. As a last measure, Calonne was hoping to bypass them by reviving an archaic institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial roster of Notables included 137 nobles, among them many future revolutionaries, such as the [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Comte de Mirabeau]] and the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], hero of the [[American Revolution]]. Lafayette had served in [[George Washington]]'s army. Much of the debt had been incurred on behalf of the Americans. The final defeat of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown|Battle of Yorktown]] was due in large part to the participation of the French army and navy. If Calonne thought he would find more cooperation by changing the assembly, he was mistaken. He proposed a &quot;land tax,&quot; ''Subvention Territoriale'', to be imposed on all land-holders, rich or poor. A storm of protest arose. Charges of mismanagement were made. Calonne was dismissed on 8 April 1787, and then was exiled. He commented on the French political scene from London.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=63–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calonne's replacement was [[Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne]], President of the Assembly of Notables. He was offered the post of Prime Minister, which was to include being Controller. The Notables nevertheless remained recalcitrant. They made a number of proposals but they would not grant the King money. Lafayette suggested that the problem required a  national assembly. Brienne asked him if he meant the Estates General. On receiving an affirmative answer, Brienne recorded it as a proposal. Frustrated by his inability to obtain money, the King staged a day-long harangue, and then on 25 May dissolved the Notables. Their proposals reverted to the Parlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle:1902|pp=70–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rebellion of the Parliament ===
Turning again to the Parliament, the King found that they were inclined to continue the issues that had been raised in the Assembly of Notables. Their proper legal function, besides giving advice to the King, was only to register, or record, his edicts as law, a matter of simple obedience, which the King's father and grandfather had been able to command, sometimes by sternness, threats, and losses of temper. Unless registered, the edicts were not lawful.

On 6 July 1787, Loménie forwarded the ''Subvention Territoriale'' and another tax, the ''Edit du Timbre'', or &quot;Stamp Act,&quot; based on the American model, for registration. Parliament refused, an illegal act, demanding accounting statements, or &quot;States,&quot; as a prior condition. It was the King's turn to refuse. The members of the Parliament began to jest that they required either the accounting States or the Estates General. The King could not let this slight to his authority pass. Parliament was commanded to assemble at the King's palace at Versailles, where, on 6 August, he ordered them in person to register the taxes. On 7 August back in Paris, the Parliament declared, in earnest this time, that the order was null and void, repudiating all previous registrations of taxes. Only the Estates General, they said, could register taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the second time the King summoned Parliament away from Paris, where crowds of people cheered their every act from the street, this time to meet at Troyes, Champagne, on 15 August. He did not personally appear. By messenger he and Parliament negotiated an agreement: the King withdrew the Stamp Tax, and modified the Land Tax to exclude the lands of people of title, in return for the assured registration of further loans. Parliament was allowed to return on 20 September. Encouraged, Loménie, with the support of the King, went beyond the intent of the Parliament, which was to grant specific loans. He proposed an ''Emprunt Successif'', &quot;Successive Loan,&quot; until 1792, giving the King a [[blank cheque]]. When the Parliament delayed, the King resorted to a ruse: he scheduled a Royal Hunt for 19 November. On that day at 11:00 AM the King and his peers noisily entered the session of Parliament dressed in hunting clothes. They would confer with each other and have the decisions registered immediately, they said.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly the entire government was now face-to-face. They argued the problems and issues concerned until dusk, some six hours later. The Parliament believed that the problem had gone beyond the government and needed the decisions of the Estates General, which did not correspond to the King's concept of monarchy. At the end of the day the King demanded the registration of the Successive Loan. The [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Duc d'Orléans]], a previous Notable, a relative of the King, and an ardent revolutionary, known as ''Philippe Égalité'', asked if this were a Royal Session of the Peers, or a Session of Parliament. On being told it was a Royal Session, he replied that edicts were not registered at Royal Sessions. The King retorted ''Vous êtes bien le maître'', &quot;do as YOU will,&quot; with some sarcasm, as the King's will was legally required, and strode angrily from the session with retinue. ''[[Lettre de cachet|Lettres de Cachet]]'', or arbitrary arrest warrants, followed on the 20th, for D'Orleans and two others. They were taken into custody and held under comfortable conditions away from Paris, D'Orleans on his country estate. Parliament began a debate on the legality of ''Lettres de Cachet''. The men being held became a ''cause célèbre''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the King and Parliament could accomplish no more together, De Brienne over the winter pressed for an alternative plan: to resurrect even more archaic institutions: the ''Grand Bailliages'', or larger legal jurisdictions that once had existed, would assume Parliament's legal functions, while the Plenary Court, last known under [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], when it had the power to register edicts, would assume the registration duties of the Parliament, leaving it with no duties to perform. The King planned a sudden revelation and dismissal of Parliament. However, [[Jean-Jacques Duval d'Eprémesnil]] heard the government presses running and bribed the printer to give him the proofs of the edict. Hearing it read the next day, 3 May 1788, the Parliament swore an oath not to be disbanded, and defined a manifesto of their rights.

Warrants were issued for Eprémesnil and another, but they escaped from their homes over the rooftops in the early morning to seek refuge in Parliament. The King sent his guards into Parliament to arrest them. They surrendered. Parliament filed silently out between a line of guards. The commander gave the key to the building to the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=86–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Return of Necker ===
The transfer of power to the new government was to begin on 8 May 1788, with the registration of the edicts establishing it in the regional Parliaments. The latter refused unanimously, following the Parliament of Paris. If the King's commissioners forced the issue, the Parliament abandoned the meeting place, only to return the next day to declare the registration null and void. Armed protest swept the kingdom. Street fighting broke out at [[Rennes]], Brittany. A deputation sent to Paris from there was imprisoned in the [[Bastille]]. The [[Breton people|Bretons]] in Paris founded the Breton Club, later the [[Jacobin]] Society. The Grand Bailliages could not be created, and the Plenary Court met only once.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Convening the Estates-General ==

=== Edict of 24 January 1789 ===
The Estates-General were summoned by a royal edict, dated to 24 January 1789. It comprised two parts: a ''Lettre du Roi'' and a ''Règlement''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Louis XVI | title=Lettre du Roi pour la Convocation des États-Généraux a Versailles, le 27 Avril, 1789, et Règlement y Annexé | location=Paris | publisher=L'Imprimerie Royale | year=1789 | page=3 | quote=Nous avons besoin du concours de nos fidèles Sujets, pour nous aider à surmonter toutes les difficultés où nous nous trouvons relativement à l'état de nos finances .... Ces grands motifs nous ont déterminés à convoquer l'assemblée des États de toutes les Provinces de notre obéissance ....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Lettre'' announces:
:&quot;We have need of a concourse of our faithful subjects, to assist us surmount all the difficulties we find relative to the state of our finances .... These great motives have resolved us to convoke the ''assemblée des États'' of all the provinces under our authority ....&quot;

The King promises to address the grievances of his people. The &quot;most notable persons&quot; of each community and judicial district are summoned &quot;to confer and to record remonstrances, complaints, and grievances.&quot; Elections for Deputies are to be held. He says that he intends &quot;reform of abuse&quot;, &quot;establishment of a fixed and durable order&quot;, and &quot;general prosperity&quot;. The ''Lettre'' is signed &quot;Louis&quot;.

''Lettres de Convocation'' were sent to all the provinces, with the ''Règlement'' prescribing the methods of election. During the preceding autumn, the Parliament of Paris, an aristocratic advisory body to the King, had decided that the organisation of the convention would be the same as in 1614, the last time the Estates had met. Some 175 years had gone by since then. The Estates were thus not a functional institution in French society. By reviving them as much as possible like they had been, the King and the Parliament intended to control the authority of the people. The previous Estates had voted by order: that is, the Nobles and the Clergy could together outvote the Commons by 2 to 1.

If, on the other hand, each delegate was to have one vote, the majority would prevail. The issue was widely discussed in the press during the autumn of 1788. The people would nevertheless accept any national convention, confident that enough members of the Nobility and the Clergy would be with them to sway the votes. A National Party was formed. It argued that France had never had a constitution and the proper function of the Convention was to establish one. The royalist defenders, on the other hand, accepted the absolute monarchy as the constitution. Just to be certain, the press began to demand that the Commons be allocated twice as many delegates as each of the other two Estates. In an attempt to bolster his failing popularity, the King acceded to this measure of &quot;doubling the Third&quot;. He was confident of his influence over the Nobility and Clergy.&lt;ref&gt;The analysis of the preceding two paragraphs is that of {{harvnb | Neely | 2008 | pp=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elections of early Spring 1789 ===
The First Estate represented 100 Catholic clergy; the Church owned about 10 percent of the land and collected its own taxes (the tithe) on peasants. The lands were controlled by bishops and abbots of monasteries, but two-thirds of the 303 delegates from the First Estate were ordinary parish priests; only 51 were bishops.&lt;ref&gt;William Doyle, '' The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) p 59&lt;/ref&gt;  The Second Estate represented the
nobility, about 400 men and women who owned about 25 percent of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their peasant tenants. About a third of the 282 deputies representing the Second Estate were nobles, mostly with minor holdings. The Third Estate representation was  doubled to 578 men, representing 95 percent of the population. Half were well educated lawyers or local officials. Nearly a third were in trades or industry; 51 were wealthy land owners.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp 99-101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Soboul, ''The French Revolution 1787–1799'' (1975) pp 127–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Réglement'' that went out by post in January thus specified separate voting for delegates of each Estate. Each tax district (cities, boroughs, and parishes) would elect their own delegates to the Third Estate. The ''Bailliages'', or judicial districts, would elect delegates to the First and Second Estates in separate ballots. Each voting assembly would also collect a ''Cahier'', or &quot;Notebook&quot;, of grievances to be considered by the Convocation. The election rules differed somewhat depending on the type of voting unit, whether city, parish, or some other. Generally the distribution of delegates was by population: the most populous locations had the greatest number of delegates. The City of Paris was thus dominant. The electorate consisted of males 25 years and older, property owners, and registered taxpayers. They could be native or naturalized citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Boyer | first1=John W. | last2=Kirshner | first2=Julius | year=1986 | editor1-first=Keith Michael | editor1-last=Baker | title=From Reform to Revolution | work=The Old Regime and the French Revolution | series=University of Chicago readings in Western civilization | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | pages=180–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of delegates elected was about 1,200, half of whom formed the Third Estate. The First and Second Estates had 300 each. But French society had changed since 1614, and these Estates-General were not identical to those of 1614. Members of the nobility were not required to stand for election to the Second Estate, and many of them were elected to the Third Estate. The total number of nobles in the three Estates was about 400. Noble representatives of the Third Estate were among the most passionate revolutionaries in attendance, including [[Jean Joseph Mounier]] and the [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|comte de Mirabeau]]. Despite their status as elected representatives of the Third Estate, many of these nobles were executed by guillotine during the Terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Guttner|first=Darius|title=The French Revolution|year=2015|publisher=Nelson Cengage|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nobles in the Second Estate were the richest and most powerful in the kingdom. The King could count on them, but that was of little use to him in the succeeding course of history. He had also expected that the First Estate would be predominantly the noble Bishops. The electorate, however, returned mainly parish priests, most of whom were sympathetic to the Commons. The Third Estate elections returned predominantly magistrates and lawyers. The lower levels of society, the landless, working men, though present in large numbers in street gangs, were totally absent from the Estates-General, as the King had called for &quot;the most notable persons&quot;.

The grievances returned were mainly about taxes, which the people considered a crushing burden. Consequently, the people and the King were totally at odds from the very beginning. Aristocratic privilege was also attacked. The people resented the fact that nobles could excuse themselves from most of the burden of taxation and service that fell on the ordinary people. A third type complained that the ubiquitous tolls and duties levied by the nobility hindered internal commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Elections results come from {{harvnb | Neely | 2008 | pp=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opening of the Convention ===
On 5 May 1789, amidst general festivities, the Estates-General convened in an elaborate but temporary ''Île des États'' set up in one of the courtyards of the official [[Menus-Plaisirs du Roi|Hôtel des Menus Plaisirs]] in the town of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] near the royal [[château]]. With the ''étiquette'' of 1614 strictly enforced, the clergy and nobility ranged in tiered seating in their full regalia, while the physical locations of the deputies from the Third Estate were at the far end, as dictated by the protocol. When Louis XVI and [[Charles Louis François de Paule de Barentin]], the Keeper of the Seals of France, addressed the deputies on 6 May, the Third Estate discovered that the royal decree granting double representation also upheld the traditional voting &quot;by orders&quot;, i.e. that the collective vote of each estate would be weighed equally.

The apparent intent of the King and of Barentin was for everyone to get directly to the matter of taxes. The larger representation of the Third Estate would remain merely a symbol, while giving them no extra power. Director-General of Finance [[Jacques Necker]] had more sympathy for the Third Estate, but on this occasion he spoke only about the fiscal situation, leaving it to Barentin to speak on how the Estates-General was to operate.

Trying to avoid the issue of representation and to focus solely on taxes, the King and his ministers had gravely misjudged the situation. The Third Estate wanted the estates to meet as one body and for each delegate to have one vote. The other two estates, while having their own grievances against royal absolutism, believed – correctly, as history was to prove – that they stood to lose more power to the Third Estate than they stood to gain from the King. Necker sympathized with the Third Estate in this matter, but the astute financier lacked equal astuteness as a politician. He decided to let the ''impasse'' play out to the point of stalemate before he would enter the fray. As a result, by the time the King yielded to the demand of the Third Estate, it seemed to all to be a concession wrung from the monarchy, rather than a magnanimous gift that would have convinced the populace of the King's goodwill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparknotes.com/history/european/frenchrev/section2.rhtml SparkNotes: ''the French Revolution'' (1789–1799): ''The Estates-General'': 1789]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Estates-General reached an impasse. The first item on the agenda involved the verification{{clarify|date=March 2014}} of powers. The [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Comte de Mirabeau]], a noble himself but elected to represent the Third Estate, tried but failed to keep all three orders in a single room for this discussion. Instead of discussing the King's taxes, the three estates began to discuss separately the organisation of the legislature. These efforts continued without success until 27 May, when the nobles voted to stand firm for separate verification. The following day, the [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Abbé Sieyès]] (a senior member of the clergy, but, like Mirabeau, elected to represent the Third Estate) moved that the representatives of the Third Estate, who now called themselves the ''Communes'' (&quot;Commons&quot;), proceed with verification and invite the other two estates to take part, but not to wait for them.

On 13 June 1789, the Third Estate had arrived at a resolution to examine and settle in common the powers of the three orders and invited to this common work those{{clarify|date=March 2014}} of the clergy and nobles. On 17 June, with the failure of efforts to reconcile the three estates, the ''Communes'' completed their own process of verification and almost immediately voted a measure far more radical: they declared themselves redefined as the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], an assembly not of the estates, but of the people. They invited the other orders to join them, but made it clear that they intended to conduct the nation's affairs with or without them. As their numbers exceeded the combined numbers of the other estates, they could dominate any combined assembly.

The King tried to resist. Under the influence of the courtiers of his [[privy council]], he resolved to go in state to the Assembly, annul its decrees, command the separation of the orders, and dictate the reforms to be effected by the restored Estates-General. On 20 June, he ordered the ''Salle des États'', the hall where the National Assembly met, closed.{{fact|date=May 2016}} The Assembly moved their deliberations to the nearby [[Jeu de paume|tennis]] court, where they proceeded to swear the '[[Tennis Court Oath]]', by which they agreed not to separate until they had settled the constitution of France. Two days later, deprived of use of the tennis court as well, the Assembly met in the [[Versailles Cathedral|Church of Saint Louis]],&lt;ref&gt;''Cathédrale Saint-Louis'', since 1843.&lt;/ref&gt; where the majority of the representatives of the clergy joined them: efforts to restore the old order had served only to accelerate events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13009a.htm ''French Revolution''] 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''séance royale'' of 23 June, the King granted a ''Charte octroyée'', a constitution granted by royal favour, which affirmed, subject to the traditional limitations, the right of separate deliberation for the three orders, which constitutionally formed three chambers. This move failed; soon, that part of the deputies of the nobles who still stood apart joined the National Assembly at the request of the King. The Estates-General had ceased to exist, having become the National Assembly (and after 9 July 1789, the [[National Constituent Assembly]]).

The '''Cahiers de doléances''' (or simply '''Cahiers''' as they were often known) were the lists of grievances drawn up by each of the three Estates in France, between March and April 1789, the year in which a revolutionary situation began. Their compilation was ordered by [[King Louis XVI]], to give each of the Estates – the First Estate (the clergy), the Second Estate (the [[nobles|nobility]]) and the Third Estate, which consisted of the proletarians (the working class), the urban and country workers – the chance to express their hopes and grievances directly to the King. They were explicitly discussed at a special meeting of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] held on May 5, 1789. Many of these lists have survived and provide considerable information about the state of the country on the eve of the revolution. The documents recorded criticisms of [[government waste]], indirect taxes, church taxes and corruption, and the hunting rights of the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, Donald &quot;The Western Heritage-Seventh Edition&quot; (Pg 631), 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

While the cahiers conveyed the grievances of common people, they were not meant as a direct challenge to the Old Regime. They were instead suggestions of reforms.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cahiers De Doléances.&quot; The French Revolution: A Document Collection. Ed. Laura Mason and Tracey Rizzo. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999. 54-58. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the writing of the cahiers forced the people of France to think about the problems that France faced, and how they wanted them fixed. The political discussions that raged throughout France were a direct challenge to the current system, as they gave the people a voice, and subsequently the cahiers were used to guide the elected representatives in what to discuss at the Estates General. In essence, they added greatly to a revolutionary air of expectation of the Estates General.

==Cahiers of the First Estate==

The Cahiers of the First Estate reflected the interests of the parish clergy. They called for an end to bishops holding more than one [[diocese]], and demanded those who were not noble be able to become bishops. In return they were prepared to give up the financial privileges of the Church. They were not, however, prepared to give up the dominant position that the Church held over the other two Estates. They did not intend to allow Protestants to practice religion, and under the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] by King Louis XIV, wanted to keep Roman Catholicism the only official religion in France.

==Cahiers of the Second Estate==

Among the three Estates, the Second Estates cahiers were possibly the most surprising. Many of them proved to be quite [[Liberalism|liberal]] in their opinions, 89% voting that they were willing to give up their financial privileges. Where, up until then, they had been against the idea of the commoners entering their ranks (as shown by the Segur Ordinance), they were finally accepting of the fact that academic merit, rather than the position held by a man because of his birth, should be the requirements to hold certain offices (the offices included Military, Administrative and [[Venal office|Venal]] Offices). They also attacked the government for being out of date, and the injustice of the [[Ancien Régime]].

==Cahiers of the Third Estate==
Many of the cahiers of the Third Estate were composed using models sent from Paris, and it is probable that cahiers from poorer villages were constrained in expressing their grievances.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cahiers De Doléances.&quot; The French Revolution: A Document Collection. Ed. Laura Mason and Tracey Rizzo. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999. 54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The cahiers were also highly variable in tone depending on where they came from, meaning that while they are often summarized as raising more sweeping and general complaints about French society at the time, many of the grievances shared were highly specific, such as Parish of St. Germain d'Airan asking &quot;That [[dovecote]]s be destroyed...and that it be ordered that those remaining shall be closed in such a way that pigeons may not leave during the times of planting and harvest.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cahiers De Doléances.&quot; The French Revolution: A Document Collection. Ed. Laura Mason and Tracey Rizzo. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999. 56. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cahiers of the Third Estate spoke out mainly against the financial privileges held by the two other Estates. They were both exempt from most taxes such as the church [[tithe]] and the [[taille]] (the main direct tax). They also wanted to have a fair voting system in the Estates-General. At the moment, they would be outvoted by the other two orders, who would combine their votes on any issue that suited them. They had double representation (600, rather than 300 members representing them), but each estate had a single vote, and thus having double the representative would only be effective if they were voting by head, and not by order.

The '''Réveillon riots''' occurred between 26–29 April 1789&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safarix.com/0131930370/app02lev1sec1 SafariX Textbooks Online – SafariX is now CourseSmart&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; centered in the [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine|St. Antoine]] district of Paris where a factory which produced luxury wallpaper was owned by [[Jean-Baptiste Réveillon]]. The factory employed around 300 people. The riots were one of the first instances of [[violence]] during the [[French Revolution]]. The factory where the riot took place was unusual in pre-revolutionary France as the factory was [[guild]]-free in an era where guilds controlled quality standards. 

Protests began after rumors spread that the owner had made a speech stating that workers, many of whom were highly skilled, were to be paid lower wages and, as a result, there would be lower prices. Workers were concerned with food shortages, high unemployment, and low wages after a difficult winter in 1789. However, Réveillon was known for his benevolence towards the poor and actually stated that bread prices should be brought down to those that people could afford (below 15 [[Solidus (coin)|sous]] a day) but his comments were misinterpreted as wage restrictions. He made the comments on 21 April when the assembly of the Saint-Marguerite was discussing its [[Cahiers de doléances|''Cahier'']] which all Estates drew up before the Estates-General was to be called. 

After informal protests on Sunday 26 April, groups of protesters congregated on the Ile de la Cité and in the [[Faubourg Saint-Marcel]], Marais, and Faubourg Saint-Antoine the next day for a series of protest-marches. Though the first three marches - one of which targeted the Third Estate's Assembly of Electors - were resolved peacefully, confrontations between troops and participants in the fourth demonstration led to the outbreak of violence in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine that evening. 

While the protesters did not manage to destroy the factory as it was being guarded by a group of around fifty troops, a factory owned by the [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] manufacturer Henriot was destroyed after he made similar comments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.periclespress.com/France.html&lt;/ref&gt; However Réveillon’s factory was destroyed a day later as was his home&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.otal.umd.edu/~msites/frchron89-90.html Chronology of the French Revolution: 1789–1790&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The riot killed 25 people&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; and wounded around the same number although rumour caused the casualty figures to be exaggerated. The [[Gardes Françaises|French Guard]] were used to restore order.

One of the central events of the [[French Revolution]] was to '''abolish feudalism''', and the old rules, taxes and privileges left over from the age of [[feudalism]]. The [[National Constituent Assembly]], acting  on the night of 4 August 1789, announced, &quot;The National Assembly abolishes the feudal system entirely.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, p 107 for full text&lt;/ref&gt;  It abolished both the [[Manorialism|seigneurial]] rights of the Second Estate (the nobility) and the [[tithe]]s gathered by the First Estate (the Catholic clergy).&lt;ref&gt;Furet, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markoff, &lt;/ref&gt;  The old judicial system, founded on the 13 regional [[Parlement|parlements]], was suspended in November 1789, and finally abolished in 1790.&lt;ref&gt; Paul R. Hanson, ''The A to Z of the French Revolution'' (2007) p 250-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==The event==
The [[Louis-Marie, vicomte de Noailles|Viscount de Noailles]] and the [[Armand, duc d'Aiguillon|Duke d'Aiguillon]] proposed the redemption and consequent abolition of feudal rights and the suppression of personal servitude, as well as the various privileges of the nobility. Members of the First Estate were at first reluctant to enter into the patriotic fervour of the night but eventually the Bishops of [[Anne Louis Henri de La Fare|Nancy]] and [[Chartres]] sacrificed their tithes. Historian [[Georges Lefebvre]] summarizes the night's work:
:Without debate the Assembly enthusiastically adopted equality of taxation and redemption of all manorial rights except for those involving personal servitude — which were to be abolished without indemnification. Other proposals followed with the same success: the equality of legal punishment, admission of all to public office, abolition of venality in office [the purchase of an office], conversion of the tithe into payments subject to redemption, freedom of worship, prohibition of plural holding of benefices, suppression of and eights.... Privileges of provinces and towns were offered as a last sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lefebvre|first=Georges|title=The French Revolution: Vol. 1, from Its Origins To 1793|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bd-JDOw8v5QC&amp;pg=PA130|year=1962|publisher=Columbia U.P,|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of a few hours, France abolished game-laws, seigneurial courts, the purchase and sale of posts in the magistracy, of pecuniary immunities, favoritism in taxation, of [[surplice]] money, first-fruits, pluralities, and unmerited pensions. Towns, provinces, companies, and cities also sacrificed their special privileges. A medal was struck to commemorate the day, and the Assembly declared Louis XVI the &quot;Restorer of French Liberty.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;J.M. Thompson, ''The French Revolution'' (1943),  pp 90-111&lt;/ref&gt; Furet emphasizes that the decisions of August 1789 survived and became an integral part of: 
:the founding texts of modern France.  They destroyed aristocratic society from top to bottom, along with its structure of dependencies and privileges.  For this structure they substituted the modern, autonomous individual, free to do whatever was not prohibited by law.... The Revolution thus distinguished itself quite early by its radical individualism &lt;ref&gt;Furet,  ''Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution, '' p 112 &lt;/ref&gt;

This &quot;[[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre|Saint Bartholomew]] of abuses,&quot; as [[François Mignet]] calls it, has often been the subject of hyperbole in the analyses of contemporaries and historians. The atmosphere inside the Assembly was so heady that confusion reigned in the provinces for months afterwards as to the true meaning of the laws. The real product of the night was not formalised until the Feudal Committee reported back on 5 March 1790. The Committee reintroduced the ''mainmorte'' (explicitly outlawed by the original decrees) and set a rate of redemption for real rights (those connected to the land) that was impossible for the majority of peasants to pay (30 times the yearly rent). 

The Russian [[anarchism|anarchist]] Prince [[Peter Kropotkin]] wrote:
:The Assembly was carried away by its enthusiasm, and in this enthusiasm nobody remarked the clause for redeeming the feudal rights and tithes, which the two nobles and the two bishops had introduced into their speeches – a clause terrible even in its vagueness, since it might mean all or nothing, and did, in fact, postpone… the abolition of feudal rights for five years – until August 1793.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin, P]]. (1927).[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/kropotkin/frenchrev/xvii.html &quot;4 August and Its Consequences&quot;], ''The Great French Revolution'', 1789–1793 (N. F. Dryhurst, Trans.) New York: Vanguard Printings. (Original work published 1909)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kropotkin concludes [https://libcom.org/library/chapter-18-feudal-rights-remain &quot;The Feudal rights remain&quot;]&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin, P]]. (1927), ''The Great French Revolution'', Chapter XVIII, 1789–1793 (N. F. Dryhurst, Trans.) New York: Vanguard Printings. (Original work published 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; and scorns the other historians &quot;The historic legend is lovingly used to embellish this night, and the majority of historians, copying the story as it has been given by a few contemporaries, represent it as a night full of enthusiasm and saintly abnegation.&quot;.

==Impact==
Originally the peasants were supposed to pay for the release of seigneurial dues; these dues affected more than a fourth of the farmland in France and provided most of the income of the large landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Forster, &quot;The survival of the nobility during the French Revolution.&quot; ''Past and Present'' (1967): 71-86 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/650023 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; The majority refused to pay and in 1793 the obligation was cancelled. Thus the peasants got their land free, and also no longer paid the tithe to the church.&lt;ref&gt; Paul R. Hanson, ''The A to Z of the French Revolution'' (2013) pp 293-94&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutherland has examined the results for peasants and landlords.  The peasants no longer had to pay the tithe to the Church. The land owners, however, were now allowed to raise rents by the same amount  as the former tithe.  The national government then taxed  away this new income to owners by raising land taxes.  Sutherland concludes that the peasants effectively paid twice, in terms of higher rents and heavier taxes.  Many tried to evade the burden.  In the long run, however, the new burdens on the tenants and landlords, were largely offset by major gains in productivity, which made everyone richer.  &lt;ref&gt;D.M.G.

On 20 June 1789, the members of the [[Estates-General of 1789|French Estates-General]] for the [[Third Estate]], who had begun to call themselves the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], took the '''Tennis Court Oath''' ({{lang-fr|Serment du Jeu de Paume}}), [[Oath|vowing]] &quot;not to separate, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the [[Kingdom of France|kingdom]] is established.&quot; It was a pivotal event in the early days of the [[French Revolution]].

The Estates-General had been called to address the country's [[Causes of the French Revolution|fiscal and agricultural crisis]], but immediately after convening in May 1788, they had become bogged down in issues of representation—particularly, whether they would vote by head (which would increase the power of the Third Estate) or by order.

On 17 June, the Third Estate, led by the [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|comte de Mirabeau]], began to call themselves the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Doyle&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first= William|title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 1990|page=105|isbn=978-0192852212}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 20 June, the deputies were shocked to discover that the chamber door was locked and guarded by soldiers. Immediately fearing the worst and anxious that a royal attack by [[King Louis XVI]] was imminent, the deputies congregated in a nearby indoor ''[[Jeu de paume|jeu de palme]]'' court in the Saint-Louis district of the city of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], near the [[Palace of Versailles]].

There, 576 of the 577 members from the [[Estates of the realm#Third Estate|Third Estate]] took a collective [[oath]] &quot;[[:fr:Serment du jeu de paume#Texte du serment|not to separate, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the kingdom is established]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Proceedings of the Bunker Hill Monument Association at the annual meeting |first=Marshall Putnam |last=Thompson |chapter= The Fifth Musketeer: The Marquis de la Fayette |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qbvW7zpvRg8C|page= 50 |year= 1914 |accessdate=10 February 2011 |postscript= {{inconsistent citations}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only person who did not join was [[Joseph Martin-Dauch]] from [[Castelnaudary]], who would not execute decisions not decided by the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the French Revolution|first=Paul R. |last=Hanson|year= 2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=9780810850521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
This oath would come to have major significance in the revolution as the Third Estate would constantly continue to protest to have more representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=John D Ruddy|title=French Revolution in 9 Minutes|date=2015-01-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1_2NwmIobU|accessdate=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have argued that, given political tensions in France at that time, the deputies' fears, even if wrong, were reasonable and that the importance of the oath goes above and beyond its context.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osen&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first= James L.|last= Osen|title=Royalist Political Thought during the French Revolution|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, CT|isbn=9780313294419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oath was both a revolutionary act, and an assertion that political authority derived from the people and their representatives rather than from the monarch himself. Their solidarity forced Louis XVI to order the clergy and the nobility to join with the Third Estate in the National Assembly in order to give the illusion that he controlled the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doyle&quot; /&gt; This oath would prove vital to the Third Estate as a step of protest that would eventually lead to more power in the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates General]], and every governing body thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = John D Ruddy|title = French Revolution in 9 Minutes|date = 2015-01-12|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1_2NwmIobU|accessdate = 2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oath signified for the first time that French citizens formally stood in opposition to Louis XVI, and the National Assembly's refusal to back down forced the king to make concessions. It was foreshadowed by, and drew considerably from, the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence]], especially the preamble. The Oath also inspired a wide variety of revolutionary activity in the months afterwards, ranging from [[riot]]ing across the French countryside to renewed calls for a written French constitution. Likewise, it reinforced the Assembly's strength and forced the King to formally request that voting occur based on head, not power.{{citation needed|date = June 2012}}
The Tennis Court Oath, which was taken in June 1789, preceded the 4 August 1789 [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolition of feudalism]] and the 26 August 1789 [[:en:Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]].

During the [[French Revolution]], the '''National Assembly''' ({{lang-fr|Assemblée nationale}}), which existed from June 13, 1789 to July 9, 1789, was a revolutionary assembly formed by the representatives of the Third Estate (the common people) of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]]; thereafter (until replaced by the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] on Sept. 30, 1791) it was known as the [[National Constituent Assembly]] ({{lang-fr|Assemblée nationale constituante}}), though popularly the shorter form persisted. 

==Background Information==
{{main|Estates-General of 1789}}
The [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] had been called on May 5, 1789 to deal with [[France]]'s financial crisis, but promptly fell to squabbling over its own structure. Its members had been elected to represent the [[estates of the realm]]: the [[Estates General (France)|1st Estate]] (the clergy), the [[Estates General (France)|2nd Estate]] (the [[nobility]]) and the [[Estates General (France)|3rd Estate]] (which, in theory, represented all of the commoners and, in practice, represented the [[bourgeoisie]]). The Third Estate had been granted &quot;double representation&quot;—that is, twice as many delegates as each of the other estates—but at the opening session on May 5, 1789 they were informed that all voting would be &quot;by power&quot; not &quot;by head&quot;, so their double representation was to be meaningless in terms of power. They refused this and proceeded to meet separately.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstRev&quot;&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/REV/FIRST.HTM The First Revolution], Revolution and After: Tragedies and Forces, World Civilizations: An Internet Classroom and Anthology, Washington State University. Accessed online 14 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mignet-1&quot;&gt;Mignet, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuttle diplomacy among the estates continued without success until May 27; on May 28, the representatives of the 3rd Estate began to meet on their own,&lt;ref name=Mignet-1&gt;Mignet, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; calling themselves the ''Communes'' (&quot;Commons&quot;) and proceeding with their &quot;verification of powers&quot; independently of the other bodies; from June 13 to June 17 they were gradually joined by some of the nobles and the majority of the clergy and other people such as the peasants. On June 13, this group began to call itself the National Assembly.{{Citation needed|reason=provide citation regarding peasants. which peasants are meant here?|date=November 2010}}

==The Assembly convenes==

This newly created assembly immediately attached itself onto the [[capital (economics)|capitalists]] — the sources of the credit needed to fund the national debt — and to the common people. They consolidated the public debt and declared all existing taxes to have been illegally imposed, but voted in these same taxes provisionally, only as long as the Assembly continued to sit. This restored the confidence of the capitalists and gave them a strong interest in keeping the Assembly in session. As for the common people, the Assembly established a committee of subsistence to deal with food shortages...&lt;ref name=Mignet-1 /&gt;

==The King resists==
[[Jacques Necker]], finance minister to Louis XVI, had earlier proposed that the king hold a ''Séance Royale'' (Royal Session) in an attempt to reconcile the divided Estates. The king agreed; but none of the three orders were formally notified of the decision to hold a Royal Session. All debates were to be put on hold until the ''séance royale'' took place. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Guttner|first=Darius|title=The French Revolution|year=2015|publisher=Nelson Cengage|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Events soon overtook Necker's complex scheme of giving in to the ''Communes'' on some points while holding firm on others. No longer interested in Necker's advice, Louis XVI, under the influence of the courtiers of his [[privy council]], resolved to go in state to the Assembly, annul its decrees, command the separation of the orders, and dictate the reforms to be effected by the restored Estates-General. On June 19, he ordered the Salle des États, the hall where the National Assembly met, closed, and remained at [[Château de Marly|Marly]] for several days while he prepared his address.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparknotes.com/history/european/frenchrev/section3.rhtml SparkNotes: the French Revolution (1789–1799): The National Assembly: 1789–1791]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confrontation and recognition==
Two days later, deprived of use of the tennis court as well, the National Assembly met in the Church of Saint Louis, where the majority of the representatives of the clergy joined them: efforts to restore the [[Ancien Régime|old order]] had served only to accelerate events. When, on June 23, in accord with his plan, the king finally addressed the representatives of all three [[estates of the realm|estates]], he encountered a stony silence. He concluded by ordering all to disperse. The nobles and clergy obeyed; the deputies of the common people remained seated in a silence finally broken by [[Honoré Mirabeau|Mirabeau]], whose short speech culminated, &quot;A military force surrounds the assembly! Where are the enemies of the nation? Is [[Catiline]] at our gates? I demand, investing yourselves with your dignity, with your legislative power, you inclose yourselves within the religion of your oath. It does not permit you to separate till you have formed a constitution.&quot; The deputies stood firm.&lt;ref name=Mignet-1/&gt;

Necker, conspicuous by his absence from the royal party on that day, found himself in disgrace with Louis, but back in the good graces of the National Assembly. Those of the clergy who had joined the Assembly at the church of Saint Louis remained in the Assembly; forty-seven members of the nobility, including the [[Louis Philippe Joseph, duc d'Orléans|Duke of Orléans]], soon joined them; by June 27, the royal party had overtly given in, although the likelihood of a military counter-coup remained in the air. The French military began to arrive in large numbers around [[Paris]] and [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].

In the ''séance royale'' of June 23, the King granted a ''Charte octroyée'', a constitution granted of the royal favour, which affirmed, subject to the traditional limitations, the right of separate deliberation for the three orders, which constitutionally formed three chambers. This move failed; soon that part of the deputies of the nobles who still stood apart joined the National Assembly at the request of the king. The Estates-General had ceased to exist, having become the National Assembly (and after July 9, 1789, the [[National Constituent Assembly]]), though these bodies consisted of the same deputies elected by the separate orders

==Reconstitution==
Messages of support poured into the Assembly from Paris and other French cities. On July 9, 1789, the Assembly, reconstituting itself as the [[National Constituent Assembly]], addressed the king in polite but firm terms, requesting the removal of the troops (which now included foreign regiments, who showed far greater obedience to the king than did his French troops), but Louis declared that he alone could judge the need for troops, and assured them that the troops had deployed strictly as a precautionary measure. Louis &quot;offered&quot; to move the assembly to [[Noyon]] or [[Soissons]]: that is to say, to place it between two armies and deprive it of the support of the Parisian people. Public outrage over this troop presence precipitated the [[Storming of the Bastille]], beginning the Revolution.

:''Not to be confused with [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1793]], a second declaration, written in 1793 but never formally adopted.''
[[File:Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789.jpg|thumb|The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789 is a fundamental document of the [[French Revolution]] and in the history of [[human rights]].]]

The '''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen''' ({{lang-fr|Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen|links=no}}), passed by France's [[National Constituent Assembly]] in August 1789, is a fundamental document of the [[French Revolution]] and in the history of [[human rights|human]] and [[civil rights]].&lt;ref&gt;The French title is sometimes translated as &quot;Declaration of Human and Civic Rights&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration was directly influenced by [[Thomas Jefferson]], working with [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|General Lafayette]], who introduced it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory Fremont-Barnes|title=Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760-1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_2wkP4j-EsC&amp;pg=PA190|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced also by the doctrine of &quot;[[Natural and legal rights|natural right]]&quot;, the rights of man are held to be [[Moral universalism|universal]]: valid at all times and in every place, pertaining to human nature itself. It became the basis for a nation of free individuals protected equally by law. It is included in the preamble of the constitutions of both the Fourth French Republic (1946) and Fifth Republic (1958) and is still current. Inspired in part by the [[American Revolution]], and also by the Enlightenment philosophers, the Declaration was a core statement of the values of the French Revolution and had a major impact on the development of [[freedom]] and [[democracy]] in Europe and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kopstein Kopstein|title=Comparative Politics: Interests, Identities, and Institutions in a Changing Global Order|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh3PVi6II54C&amp;pg=PA72|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration, together with the [[Magna Carta]], the [[United States Declaration of Independence|American Declaration of Independence]], [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], and [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], inspired in large part the 1948 [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas K. Stevenson (1987), ''American Life and Institutions'', Stuttgart (Germany), p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The inspiration and content of the document emerged largely from the ideals of the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Georges Lefebvre|title=The Coming of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4EYuia7buUC&amp;pg=PA212|year=2005|publisher=Princeton UP|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The key drafts were prepared by Lafayette, working at times with his close friend Thomas Jefferson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Athan Billias, ed.|title=American Constitutionalism Heard Round the World, 1776-1989: A Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WV0nP5n_AoC&amp;pg=PA92|year=2009|publisher=NYU Press|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Dunn, ''Sister Revolutions: French Lightning, American Light'' (1999) pp 143-45&lt;/ref&gt; who drew heavily upon [[Virginia Declaration of Rights|The Virginia Declaration of Rights]], drafted in May 1776 by [[George Mason]] (which was based in part on the English [[Bill of Rights 1689]]), as well as Jefferson's own drafts for the American [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. In August 1789, [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Honoré Mirabeau]] played a central role in conceptualizing and drafting the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Baker, &quot;The Idea of a Declaration of Rights&quot; in Dale Van Kley, ed. ''The French Idea of Freedom: The Old Regime and the Declaration of Rights of 1789'' (1997) pp 154-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen was adopted on [[26 August]] [[1789]] by the [[National Constituent Assembly]], during the period of the French Revolution, as the first step toward writing a constitution for France. Inspired by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the original version of the Declaration was discussed by the representatives on the basis of a 24 article draft proposed by {{cl-span|the sixth bureau|date=November 2014}},&lt;ref&gt;The original draft is an annex to the 12 August report (Archives parlementaires, 1,&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; série, tome VIII, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k495230.image.f499.langFR débats du 12 août 1789], p. 431).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archives parlementaires, 1&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; série, tome VIII, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k495230.image.f527.langFR débats du 19 août 1789], p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[:fr:Jérôme Champion de Cicé|Jérôme Champion de Cicé]]. The draft was later modified during the debates. A second and lengthier declaration, known as the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1793]], was written in 1793 but never formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760-1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30EEq8R2feIC&amp;pg=PA159|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|pages=159 vol 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical and theoretical context==

The concepts in the Declaration come from the philosophical and political duties of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], such as [[individualism]], the [[social contract]] as theorized by the Genevan philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], and the [[separation of powers]] espoused by the [[Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]. As can be seen in the texts, the French declaration is heavily influenced by the political philosophy of the Enlightenment, by Enlightenment principles of human rights, and by the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] which preceded it (4 July 1776). Thomas Jefferson—the primary author of the U.S. Declaration of Independence—was at the time in France as a U.S. diplomat, and worked closely with Lafayette in designing a bill of rights for France. In the ratification by the states of the [[U.S. Constitution]] in 1788, critics had demanded a written Bill of Rights. In response, [[James Madison]]'s proposal for a [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]] was introduced in New York on 8 June 1789, 11 weeks before the French declaration. Considering the 6 to 8 weeks it took news to cross the Atlantic, it is possible that the French knew of the American text. But, as Lafebvre notes, both texts emerged from the same shared intellectual heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lefebvre|title=The Coming of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4EYuia7buUC&amp;pg=PA213|pages=212–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same people took part in shaping both documents; Lafayette admired Jefferson, and Jefferson in turn found Lafayette useful, writing in 1787 that Lafayette was &quot;a most valuable auxiliary to me. His zeal is unbounded, &amp; his weight with those in power, great.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis D. Cogliano, ed.|title=A Companion to Thomas Jefferson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YngYVO5asK4C&amp;pg=PT127|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Iain McLean concludes that Jefferson worked hard to influence the French Declaration and that Lafayette was &quot;the ideal tool for Jefferson's interests as they broadened from American trade to French politics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cogliano, ed.|title=A Companion to Thomas Jefferson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YngYVO5asK4C&amp;pg=PT127|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iain McLean, &quot;Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and the Déclaration des Droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen&quot; in ''The future of liberal democracy: Thomas Jefferson and the contemporary world'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2004) [http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/Politics/papers/2002/w24/ddhc3.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration is in the spirit of &quot;secular natural law&quot;, which does not base itself on religious doctrine or authority, in contrast with traditional [[natural law]] theory, which does.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merryman 2007 16&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Merryman| first = John Henry|author2=Rogelip Perez-Perdomo| title = The civil law tradition: an introduction to the legal system of Europe and Latin America| publisher=Stanford University Press | year = 2007| location =| page = 16| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6OJf9CbgKTkC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen#v=onepage&amp;q=Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Man%20and%20of%20the%20Citizen&amp;f=false| doi =| id =| isbn =9780804755696 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration defines a single set of individual and collective rights for all men. Influenced by the doctrine of natural rights, these rights are held to be [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] and valid in all times and places. For example, &quot;Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;First Article, Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.&lt;/ref&gt; They have certain natural rights to [[property]], to liberty, and to life. According to this theory, the role of government is to recognize and secure these rights. Furthermore, government should be carried on by elected representatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merryman 2007 16&quot;/&gt;

At the time of writing, the rights contained in the declaration were only awarded to men. Furthermore, the declaration was a statement of vision rather than reality. The declaration was not deeply rooted in either the practice of the West or even France at the time. The declaration emerged in the late 18th century out of war and revolution. It encountered opposition as democracy and [[individual rights]] were frequently regarded as synonymous with [[anarchy]] and [[subversion]]. The declaration embodies ideals and aspirations towards which France pledged to struggle in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lauren| first = Paul Gordon| authorlink = | title = The evolution of international human rights: visions seen| publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2003| location =| page = 32| url = https://books.google.com/?id=gHRhWgbWyzMC&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen| doi =| id = | isbn =9780812218541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substance==

The Declaration is introduced by a preamble describing the fundamental characteristics of the rights which are qualified as being &quot;natural, unalienable and sacred&quot; and consisting of &quot;simple and incontestable principles&quot; on which citizens could base their demands. In the second article, &quot;the natural and imprescriptible rights of man&quot; are defined as &quot;liberty, property, security and [[right of revolution|resistance to oppression]]&quot;. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges by proclaiming an end to [[feudalism]] and to exemptions from taxation, freedom and equal rights for all human beings (referred to as &quot;Men&quot;), and access to public office based on talent. The monarchy was restricted, and all citizens were to have the right to take part in the legislative process. [[Freedom of speech]] and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Spielvogel| first = Jackson J.| title = Western Civilization: 1300 to 1815| publisher=Wadsworth Publishing | year = 2008| location = | page = 580| url = https://books.google.com/?id=0QKxEJF-zQQC&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen | isbn = 978-0-495-50289-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration also asserted the principles of [[popular sovereignty]], in contrast to the [[divine right of kings]] that characterized the French monarchy, and social equality among citizens, &quot;All the citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally admissible to all public dignities, places, and employments, according to their capacity and without distinction other than that of their virtues and of their talents,&quot; eliminating the special rights of the nobility and clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Guttner|first=Darius|title=The French Revolution|url=https://www.academia.edu/9869783/The_French_Revolution|year=2015|publisher=Nelson Cengage|pages=85–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles:

'''Article I''' - Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.  Social distinctions can be founded only on the common good.

'''Article II''' - The goal of any political association is the conservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man.  These rights are liberty, property, safety and resistance against oppression.

'''Article III''' - The principle of any sovereignty resides essentially in the Nation.  No body, no individual can exert authority which does not emanate expressly from it.

'''Article IV''' - Liberty consists of doing anything which does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of each man has only those borders which assure other members of the society the enjoyment of these same rights.  These borders can be determined only by the law.

'''Article V''' - The law has the right to forbid only actions harmful to society.  Anything which is not forbidden by the law cannot be impeded, and no one can be constrained to do what it does not order.

'''Article VI''' - The law is the expression of the general will.  All the citizens have the right of contributing personally or through their representatives to its formation.  It must be the same for all, either that it protects, or that it punishes.  All the citizens, being equal in its eyes, are equally admissible to all public dignities, places and employments, according to their capacity and without distinction other than that of their virtues and of their talents.

'''Article VII''' - No man can be accused, arrested nor detained but in the cases determined by the law, and according to the forms which it has prescribed.  Those who solicit, dispatch, carry out or cause to be carried out arbitrary orders, must be punished; but any citizen called or seized under the terms of the law must obey at once; he renders himself culpable by resistance.

'''Article VIII''' - The law should establish only penalties that are strictly and evidently necessary, and no one can be punished but under a law established and promulgated before the offense and legally applied.

'''Article IX''' - Any man being presumed innocent until he is declared culpable, if it is judged indispensable to arrest him, any rigor which would not be necessary for the securing of his person must be severely reprimanded by the law.

'''Article X''' - No one may be disturbed for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their manifestation does not trouble the public order established by the law.

'''Article XI''' - The free communication of thoughts and of opinions is one of the most precious rights of man: any citizen thus may speak, write, print freely, except to respond to the abuse of this liberty, in the cases determined by the law.

'''Article XII''' - The guarantee of the rights of man and of the citizen necessitates a public force: this force is thus instituted for the advantage of all and not for the particular utility of those in whom it is trusted.

'''Article XIII''' - For the maintenance of the public force and for the expenditures of administration, a common contribution is indispensable; it must be equally distributed between all the citizens, according to their ability to pay.

'''Article XIV''' - Each citizen has the right to ascertain, by himself or through his representatives, the need for a public tax, to consent to it freely, to know the uses to which it is put, and of determining the proportion, basis, collection, and duration.

'''Article XV''' - The society has the right of requesting account from any public agent of its administration.

'''Article XVI''' - Any society in which the guarantee of rights is not assured, nor the separation of powers determined, has no Constitution.

'''Article XVII''' - Property being an inviolable and sacred right, no one can be deprived of private usage, if it is not when the public necessity, legally noted, evidently requires it, and under the condition of a just and prior indemnity.

===Active and passive citizenship===
While the [[French Revolution]] provided rights to a larger portion of the population, there remained a distinction between those who obtained the political rights in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen and those who did not. Those who were deemed to hold these political rights were called active citizens. [[Active citizenship]] was granted to men who were French, at least 25 years old, paid taxes equal to three days work, and could not be defined as servants [http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/282/ (Thouret)].&lt;ref&gt;Thouret 1789, http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/282/&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that at the time of the Declaration only male property owners held these rights.&lt;ref&gt;Censer and Hunt 2001, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  The deputies in the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] believed that only those who held tangible interests in the nation could make informed political decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popkin 2006, p. 46&quot;&gt;Popkin 2006, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction directly affects articles 6, 12, 14, and 15 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen as each of these rights is related to the right to vote and to participate actively in the government. With the decree of 29 October 1789, the term active citizen became embedded in French politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doyle 1989, p. 124&quot;&gt;Doyle 1989, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[passive citizens]] was created to encompass those populations that had been excluded from political rights in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. Because of the requirements set down for active citizens, the vote was granted to approximately 4.3 million Frenchmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doyle 1989, p. 124&quot;/&gt; out of a population of around 29 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap1a.html &quot;Social Causes of the Revolution&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  These omitted groups included women, slaves, children, and foreigners. As these measures were voted upon by the General Assembly, they limited the rights of certain groups of citizens while implementing the democratic process of the new [[French First Republic|French Republic (1792–1804)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Popkin 2006, p. 46&quot;/&gt; This legislation, passed in 1789, was amended by the creators of the [[Constitution of the Year III]] in order to eliminate the label of active citizen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doyle 1989, p. 420&quot;&gt;Doyle 1989, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; The power to vote was then, however, to be granted solely to substantial property owners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doyle 1989, p. 420&quot;/&gt;

Tensions arose between active and passive citizens throughout the Revolution. This happened when passive citizens started to call for more rights, or when they openly refused to listen to the ideals set forth by active citizens. This [http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/75/ cartoon] clearly demonstrates the difference that existed between the active and passive citizens along with the tensions associated with such differences.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Active/Passive Citizen&quot;, http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/75/.&lt;/ref&gt; In the cartoon, a passive citizen is holding a spade and a wealthy landowning active citizen is ordering the passive citizens to go to work. The act appears condescending to the passive citizen and it revisits the reasons why the French Revolution began in the first place.

Women, in particular, were strong passive citizens who played a significant role in the Revolution. [[Olympe de Gouges]] penned her [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]] in 1791 and drew attention to the need for gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;De Gouges, &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Women&quot;, 1791.&lt;/ref&gt; By supporting the ideals of the French Revolution and wishing to expand them to women, she represented herself as a revolutionary citizen. Madame Roland also established herself as an influential figure throughout the Revolution. She saw women of the French Revolution as holding three roles; &quot;inciting revolutionary action, formulating policy, and informing others of revolutionary events.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dalton 2001, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; By working with men, as opposed to working separate from men, she may have been able to further the fight of revolutionary women. As players in the French Revolution, women occupied a significant role in the civic sphere by forming social movements and participating in popular clubs, allowing them societal influence, despite their lack of direct political influence.&lt;ref&gt;Levy and Applewhite 2002, pp. 319–20, 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's rights===
The Declaration recognized many rights as belonging to citizens (who could only be male). This was despite the fact that after [[The March on Versailles]] on 5 October 1789, women presented the [[Women's Petition to the National Assembly]] in which they proposed a decree giving women equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/629/ Women's Petition to the National Assembly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, [[Nicolas de Condorcet]] and [[Etta Palm d'Aelders]] unsuccessfully called on the National Assembly to extend civil and political rights to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Letters written in France |last=Williams |first= Helen Maria |authorlink= |author2=Neil Fraistat |author3=Susan Sniader Lanser |author4=David Brookshire  |year=2001 |publisher=Broadview Press Ltd |location= |isbn=978-1-55111-255-8 |page=246  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Ruwz82RicgC&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Condorcet declared that &quot;he who votes against the right of another, whatever the religion, color, or sex of that other, has henceforth abjured his own&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The evolution of international human rights |last=Lauren |first=Paul Gordon |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-8122-1854-1 |pages=18–20 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=gHRhWgbWyzMC&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French Revolution did not lead to a recognition of [[women's rights]] and this prompted [[Olympe de Gouges]] to publish the [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]] in September 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431–1933 |last=Naish |first=Camille |authorlink= |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn= 978-0-415-05585-7 |page=136 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=OHYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen is modelled on the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and is ironic in formulation and exposes the failure of the [[French Revolution]], which had been devoted to [[Egalitarianism|equality]]. It states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“This revolution will only take effect when all women become fully aware of their deplorable condition, and of the rights they have lost in society”.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen follows the seventeen articles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen point for point and has been described by Camille Naish as &quot;almost a parody... of the original document&quot;. The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen proclaims that &quot;Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on common utility.&quot; The first article of Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen replied: &quot;Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights. Social distinctions may only be based on common utility&quot;.

De Gouges also draws attention to the fact that under French law women were fully punishable, yet denied equal rights, declaring &quot;Women have the right to mount the scaffold, they must also have the right to mount the speaker's rostrum&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431–1933 |last=Naish |first=Camille |authorlink= |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn= 978-0-415-05585-7 |page=137  |url= https://books.google.com/?id=OHYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
The declaration did not revoke the institution of slavery, as lobbied for by Jacques-Pierre Brissot's ''[[Slavery abolition efforts by Les Amis des Noirs|Les Amis des Noirs]]'' and defended by the group of colonial planters called the Club Massiac because they met at the Hôtel Massiac.&lt;ref&gt;The club of reactionary colonial proprietors meeting since July 1789 were opposed to representation in the Assemblée of France's overseas dominions, for fear &quot;that this would expose delicate colonial issues to the hazards of debate in the Assembly&quot;, as Robin Blackburn expressed it (Blackburn, The Overthrow of Colonial Slavery, 1776–1848 [1988:174f]); see also the speech of [[Jean-Baptiste Belley]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of explicit mention of slavery in the Declaration, slave uprisings in [[Saint-Domingue]] in the [[Haitian Revolution]] took inspiration from its words, as discussed in [[C. L. R. James]]' history of the Haitian Revolution, ''[[The Black Jacobins]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Heinrich August Winkler (2012), ''Geschichte des Westens. Von den Anfängen in der Antike bis zum 20. Jahrhundert'', Third Edition, Munich (Germany), p. 386&lt;/ref&gt;

Deplorable conditions for the thousands of slaves in Saint-Domingue, the most profitable slave colony in the world, led to the uprisings which would be known as the first successful slave revolt in the New World. Slavery in the French colonies was [[Abolitionism#First general abolition of slavery|abolished]] by the Convention dominated by the Jacobins in 1794. However, Napoleon reinstated it in 1802. In 1804, the colony of Saint-Domingue became an independent state, the [[Republic of Haiti]].

==Legacy==

The Declaration has also influenced and inspired rights-based [[liberal democracy]] throughout the world. It was translated as soon as 1793–1794 by Colombian [[Antonio Nariño]], who published it despite the [[Inquisition]] and was sentenced to be imprisoned for ten years for doing so. In 2003, the document was listed on UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World register]].

===Constitution of the French Fifth Republic===
{{main|Constitution of the French Fifth Republic}}
According to the [[preamble]] of the [[Constitution of the French Fifth Republic]] (adopted on 4 October 1958, and the current constitution), the principles set forth in the Declaration have constitutional value. Many laws and regulations have been cancelled because they did not comply with those principles as interpreted by the [[Conseil Constitutionnel]] (&quot;Constitutional Council of France&quot;) or by the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' (&quot;Council of State&quot;).
* Taxation legislation or practices that seem to make some unwarranted difference between citizens are struck down as unconstitutional.
* Suggestions of [[positive discrimination]] on ethnic grounds are rejected because they infringe on the principle of equality, since they would establish categories of people that would, by birth, enjoy greater rights.

The '''Storming of the Bastille''' ({{lang-fr|Prise de la Bastille}} {{IPA-fr|pʁiz də la bastij|}}) occurred in [[Paris]], [[France]], on the afternoon of 14 July 1789. The medieval [[fortress]], [[armory]], and [[political prison]] in Paris known as the [[Bastille]] represented royal authority in the center of Paris. The prison contained just seven inmates at the time of its storming but was a symbol of the abuse of the monarchy; its fall was the [[Flashpoint (politics)|flashpoint]] of the [[French Revolution]].

In France, ''Le quatorze juillet'' (14 July) is a public holiday, usually called [[Bastille Day]] in English.

==Background==
During the reign of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], France faced a major [[inflation|economic crisis]], partially initiated by the cost of intervening in the [[France in the American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], and exacerbated by a [[Regressive tax|regressive system of taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], pages 60-71 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 May 1789, the [[Estates-General of 1789]] convened to deal with this issue, but were held back by archaic protocols and the conservatism of the [[Estates of the realm#In France|Second Estate]], consisting of the nobility and amounting to only 2% of France's population at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 402 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June 1789, the [[Estates of the realm#In France|Third Estate]], with its representatives drawn from the commoners, reconstituted themselves as the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], a body whose purpose was the creation of a French constitution. The king initially opposed this development, but was forced to acknowledge the authority of the assembly, which subsequently renamed itself the [[National Constituent Assembly]] on 9 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;M. J. Sydenham page 46&quot;&gt;M. J. Sydenham, page 46 ''The French Revolution'', B. T. Batsford Ltd London 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

The commoners had formed the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]], sporting ''tricolour'' [[cockade]]s (''cocardes'') of blue, white and red, formed by combining the red and blue cockade of [[Paris]] and the white cockade of the king. These cockades, and soon simply their colour scheme, became the symbol of the revolution and, later, [[Tricouleur|of France itself]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Lefebvre]], page 114 ''The Coming of the French Revolution'', ISBN 9780691121888&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris, close to insurrection and, in [[François Mignet]]'s words, &quot;intoxicated with liberty and enthusiasm&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mignet, History..., Chapter I&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mignet|1824|loc=§Chapter I}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed wide support for the Assembly. The press published the Assembly's debates; political debate spread beyond the Assembly itself into the public squares and halls of the capital. The [[Palais-Royal]] and its grounds became the site of an ongoing meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], pages 370-371 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd, on the authority of the meeting at the Palais-Royal, broke open the [[Prison de l'Abbaye|prisons of the ''Abbaye'']] to release some grenadiers of the [[Gardes Françaises|French guards]], reportedly imprisoned for refusing to fire on the people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 371 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly recommended the imprisoned guardsmen to the clemency of the king; they returned to prison, and received pardon.

On 11 July 1789, with troops at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], [[Sèvres]], the [[Champ de Mars]], and [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], Louis XVI, acting under the influence of the conservative nobles of his [[privy council]], dismissed and banished his finance minister, [[Jacques Necker]], who had been sympathetic to the Third Estate, and completely reconstructed the ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Munro Price]], pages 85-87 ''The Fall of the French Monarchy'', ISBN 0-330-48827-9&lt;/ref&gt; The marshals [[Victor-François, 2nd duc de Broglie|Victor-François, duc de Broglie]], [[la Galissonnière]], the [[Paul François de Quelen, duc de la Vauguyon|duc de la Vauguyon]], the Baron [[Louis Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil|Louis de Breteuil]], and the intendant [[Foulon]], took over the posts of [[Louis Pierre de Chastenet de Puységur|Puységur]], [[Armand Marc, comte de Montmorin]], [[César Guillaume de La Luzerne|La Luzerne]], [[François-Emmanuel Guignard, comte de Saint-Priest|Saint-Priest]], and Necker.
[[File:Jacquesnecker.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Jacques Necker]] (1732–1804), French minister of finance]]

News of Necker's dismissal reached Paris in the afternoon of Sunday, 12 July. The Parisians generally presumed that the dismissal marked the start of a coup by conservative elements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Munro Price]], page 85 ''The Fall of the French Monarchy'', ISBN 0-330-48827-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Liberal Parisians were further enraged by the fear that a concentration of Royal troops, brought to Versailles from frontier garrisons, would attempt to shut down the [[National Constituent Assembly]], which was meeting in Versailles. Crowds gathered throughout Paris, including more than ten thousand at the Palais-Royal. [[Camille Desmoulins]] successfully rallied the crowd by &quot;mounting a table, pistol in hand, exclaiming: '''Citizens, there is no time to lose; the dismissal of Necker is the knell of a [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre|Saint Bartholomew]] for patriots! This very night all the Swiss and German battalions will leave the [[Champ de Mars, Paris|Champ de Mars]] to massacre us all; one resource is left; to take arms''!'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mignet, History..., Chapter I&quot; /&gt;

The Swiss and German regiments referred to were among the foreign [[mercenary]] troops who made up a significant portion of the pre-revolutionary [[Armée Française|Royal Army]], and were seen as being less likely to be sympathetic to the popular cause than ordinary French soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Munro Price]], page 76 ''The Fall of the French Monarchy'', ISBN 0-330-48827-9&lt;/ref&gt; By early July, approximately half of the 25,000 regular troops in Paris and Versailles were drawn from these foreign regiments. The French regiments included in the concentration appear to have been selected either because of the proximity of their garrisons to Paris or because their colonels were supporters of the reactionary &quot;court party&quot; opposed to reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;M. J. Sydenham page 46&quot;/&gt;

During the public demonstrations that started on 12 July, the multitude displayed busts of Necker and of [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], then marching from the Palais Royal through the theater district before continuing westward along the boulevards. The crowd clashed with the Royal German Cavalry Regiment (&quot;Royal-Allemand&quot;) between the  [[Place Vendôme]] and the [[Tuileries Palace]]. From atop the [[Champs-Élysées]], the Prince de Lambesc unleashed a cavalry charge that dispersed the remaining protesters at Place Louis XV—now [[Place de la Concorde]].&lt;ref&gt;Micah Alpaugh, &quot;The Politics of Escalation in French Revolutionary Protest: Political Demonstrations, Nonviolence and Violence in the ''Grandes journees'' of 1789&quot;, ''French History'' (Fall 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal commander, [[Pierre Victor Besenval de Bronstatt|Baron de Besenval]], fearing the results of a blood bath amongst the poorly armed crowds or defections among his own men, then withdrew the cavalry towards Sèvres.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 385 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, unrest was growing among the people of Paris who expressed their hostility against state authorities by attacking customs posts blamed for causing increased food and wine prices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Cobb]] and Colin James, page 73 ''The French Revolution. Voices From a Momentous Epoch 1789–1795'', CN 8039 Guild Publishing 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Paris started to plunder any place where food, guns and supplies could be hoarded. That night, rumors spread that supplies were being hoarded at Saint-Lazare, a huge property of the clergy, which functioned as convent, hospital, school and even as a jail. An angry mob broke in and plundered the property, seizing 52 wagons of wheat, which were taken to the public market. That same day multitudes of people plundered many other places including weapon arsenals. The Royal troops did nothing to stop the spreading of social chaos in Paris during those days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Louis, Bergeron |title=Le Monde et son Histoire |location=Paris |year=1970 |page=Volume VII, Chapter VI }} Micah Alpaugh, &quot;The Politics of Escalation in French Revolutionary Protest: Political Demonstrations, Nonviolence and Violence in the Grandes Journees of 1789&quot;, ''French History'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Armed conflict==
[[File:La Bastille 20060809.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Bastille|Bastille of Paris]] before the Revolution.]]
The regiment of [[Gardes Françaises]] (French Guards) formed the permanent garrison of Paris and, with many local ties, was favourably disposed towards the popular cause.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Crowdy, page 6 ''French Revolutionary Infantry 1789–1802'', ISBN 1-84176-660-7&lt;/ref&gt;  This regiment had remained confined to its barracks during the initial stages of the mid-July disturbances. With Paris becoming the scene of a general riot, [[Charles Eugene, Prince of Lambesc]] (Marshal of the Camp, Proprietor of the Royal Allemand-Dragoons), not trusting the regiment to obey his order, posted sixty dragoons to station themselves before its dépôt in the [[Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin|Chaussée d'Antin]]. The officers of the French Guards made ineffectual attempts to rally their men. The rebellious citizenry had now acquired a trained military contingent. As word of this spread, the commanders of the royal forces encamped on the Champ de Mars became doubtful of the dependability of even the foreign regiments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Munro Price]], pages 96-97 ''The Fall of the French Monarchy'', ISBN 0-330-48827-9&lt;/ref&gt; The future &quot;Citizen King&quot;, [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe, duc d'Orléans]], witnessed these events as a young officer and was of the opinion that the soldiers would have obeyed orders if put to the test. He also commented in retrospect that the officers of the French Guards had neglected their responsibilities in the period before the uprising, leaving the regiment too much to the control of its [[non-commissioned officer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Comments recorded in diary entries made by Louis-Philipp during 1789&lt;/ref&gt; However, the uncertain leadership of [[Pierre Victor Besenval de Bronstatt|Besenval]] led to a virtual abdication of royal authority in central Paris. A &quot;bourgeois militia&quot; arose through the sixty voting districts of Paris to take control over the insurrection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colin James page 75&quot;&gt;[[Richard Cobb]] and Colin James, page 75 ''The French Revolution. Voices From a Momentous Epoch 1789–1795'', CN 8039 Guild Publishing 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storming the Bastille (14 July 1789)==
On the morning of 14 July 1789, the city of Paris was in a state of alarm. The partisans of the Third Estate in France, now under the control of the Bourgeois Militia of Paris (soon to become Revolutionary France's National Guard), had earlier stormed the [[Les Invalides|Hôtel des Invalides]] without meeting significant opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Cobb]] and Colin James, page 68 ''The French Revolution. Voices From a Momentous Epoch 1789–1795'', CN 8039 Guild Publishing 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Their intention had been to gather the weapons held there (29,000 to 32,000 muskets, but without powder or shot). The commandant at the Invalides had in the previous few days taken the precaution of transferring 250 barrels of gunpowder to the Bastille for safer storage.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 399 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, the Bastille was nearly empty, housing only seven prisoners:&lt;ref&gt;''Civilisation: A Personal View'', Kenneth Clark, Penguin, 1987, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; four [[forgery|forgers]], two &quot;lunatics&quot; and one &quot;deviant&quot; aristocrat, the Comte de Solages (the [[Marquis de Sade]] had been transferred out ten days earlier).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; 
 
The cost of maintaining a garrisoned medieval fortress for so limited a purpose had led to a decision being made shortly before the disturbances began to replace it with an open public space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 398 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt; Amid the tensions of July 1789 the building remained as a symbol of royal tyranny.

The regular garrison consisted of 82 ''invalides'' (veteran soldiers no longer suitable for service in the field).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Connelly|first=Owen |authorlink=Owen Connelly |title=The Wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon 1792–1815|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It had however been reinforced on 7 July by 32 grenadiers of the Swiss Salis-Samade Regiment from the regular troops on the Champ de Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Tozzi, pages 54 &quot;Nationalizing France's Army. Foreign, Black and Jewish Troops in the French Military, 1715-1831, ISBN 978-0-8139-3833-2&lt;/ref&gt; The walls mounted eighteen eight-pound guns and twelve smaller pieces. The governor was [[Bernard-René de Launay]], son of the previous governor and actually born within the Bastille.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;

The official list of ''vainqueurs de la Bastille''  (conquerors of the Bastille) subsequently compiled has 954 names,&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hibbert|Hibbert, Christopher]]. ''The French Revolution'' (1980), p. 82 (1982 Penguin Books edition)&lt;/ref&gt; and the total of the crowd was probably fewer than one thousand. A breakdown of occupations included in the list indicates that the majority were local artisans, together with some regular army deserters and a few distinctive categories such as twenty-one wine merchants.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 400 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The crowd gathered outside around mid-morning, calling for the surrender of the prison, the removal of the cannon and the release of the arms and gunpowder.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], pages 399 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt;  Two representatives of the crowd outside were invited into the fortress and negotiations began, and another was admitted around noon with definite demands. The negotiations dragged on while the crowd grew and became impatient.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 400-401 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1:30, the crowd surged into the undefended outer courtyard. A small party climbed onto the roof of a building next to the gate to the inner courtyard and broke the chains on the [[drawbridge]], crushing one unfortunate ''vainqueur'' as it fell. Soldiers of the garrison called to the people to withdraw but in the noise and confusion these shouts were misinterpreted as encouragement to enter.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Gunfire began, apparently spontaneously, turning the crowd into a mob. The crowd seems to have felt that they had been intentionally drawn into a trap and the fighting became more violent and intense, while attempts by deputies to organise a cease-fire were ignored by the attackers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

The firing continued, and after 3 pm the attackers were reinforced by mutinous ''gardes françaises'', along with two cannons. A substantial force of Royal Army troops encamped on the Champs de Mars did not intervene.&lt;ref&gt;[[Munro Price]], page 89 ''The Fall of the French Monarchy'', ISBN 0-330-48827-9&lt;/ref&gt; With the possibility of mutual carnage suddenly apparent, Governor de Launay ordered a cease-fire at 5 pm. A letter offering his terms was handed out to the besiegers through a gap in the inner gate. His demands were refused, but de Launay nonetheless capitulated, as he realised that with limited food stocks and no water supply&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; his troops could not hold out much longer. He accordingly opened the gates to the inner courtyard, and the ''vainqueurs'' swept in to liberate the fortress at 5:30.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 403 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Ninety-eight attackers and one defender had died in the actual fighting, a disparity accounted for by the protection provided to the garrison by the fortress walls.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], pages 403-404 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt; De Launay was seized and dragged towards the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] in a storm of abuse. Outside the Hôtel, a discussion as to his fate began.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 404 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt;  The badly beaten de Launay shouted &quot;Enough! Let me die!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 405 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt; and kicked a pastry cook named Dulait in the groin. De Launay was then stabbed repeatedly and died; his head was cut off and put on a [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] to be carried through the streets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 404 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt; The three officers of the permanent Bastille garrison were also killed by the crowd; surviving police reports detail their wounds and clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. B. Morton]], appendix ''The Bastille Falls: and other studies of the French Revolution'', Longmans, Green &amp; Co, London 1936&lt;/ref&gt;
Two of the ''invalides'' of the garrison were lynched, but all but two of the Swiss regulars of the Salis-Samade Regiment were protected by the French Guards and eventually released to return to their regiment. Their officer, Lieutenant Louis de Flue, wrote a detailed report on the defense of the Bastille, which was incorporated in the logbook of the Salis-Samade and has survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;Révue Retrospective 1834&quot;&gt;&quot;Rélation de la prise de la Bastille le 14 juillet 1789 par un de ses défenseurs&quot;, in ''Révue Retrospective'', vol. 4 (Paris: M. J. Taschereau, 1834)&lt;/ref&gt; It is (perhaps unfairly) critical of the dead Marquis de Launay, whom de Flue accuses of weak and indecisive leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Révue Retrospective 1834&quot;/&gt; The blame for the fall of the Bastille would rather appear to lie with the inertia of the commanders of the 5,000&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hibbert, page 70 ''The French Revolution'', ISBN 978-0140049459&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Army troops encamped on the Champs de Mars, who did not act when either the nearby Hôtel des Invalides or the Bastille were attacked.

Returning to the Hôtel de Ville, the mob accused the ''prévôt ès marchands'' (roughly, mayor) [[Jacques de Flesselles]] of treachery, and he was assassinated en route to an ostensible trial at the [[Palais-Royal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Days of the French Revolution |last=Hibbert |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Hibbert |year=1980 |publisher=William Morrow and Co. |location=New York |isbn=0-688-03704-6 |pages=69–82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

[[File:Colonne de Juillet 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Place de la Bastille]] and the [[July Column]] where the Bastille once stood.]]

The king first learned of the storming only the next morning through the [[François Alexandre Frédéric, duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt|Duke of La Rochefoucauld]]. &quot;Is it a revolt?&quot; asked Louis XVI. The duke replied: &quot;No sire, it's not a revolt; it's a revolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Chaussinand-Nogaret, ''La Bastille est prise'', Paris, Éditions Complexe, 1988, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The citizenry of Paris, expecting a counterattack, entrenched the streets, built barricades of paving stones, and armed themselves as well as they could, especially with improvised [[pike (weapon)|pikes]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Meanwhile, at Versailles, the Assembly remained ignorant of most of the Paris events, but eminently aware that Marshal de Broglie stood on the brink of unleashing a pro-Royalist coup to force the Assembly to adopt the order of 23 June&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate= 22 January 2009 |url= http://sourcebook.fsc.edu/history/seance.html |title= The Séance royale of 23&amp;nbsp;June 1789 |publisher= [[Fitchburg State College]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then to dissolve. The [[Louis-Marie, vicomte de Noailles|vicomte de Noailles]] apparently first brought reasonably accurate news of the Paris events to Versailles. M. Ganilh and Bancal-des-Issarts, dispatched to the Hôtel de Ville, confirmed his report.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], pages 419-420 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt;

By the morning of 15 July, the outcome appeared clear to the king as well, and he and his military commanders backed down.&lt;ref&gt;[[Munro Price]], page 92 ''The Fall of the French Monarchy'', ISBN 0-330-48827-9&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal troops concentrated around Paris dispersed to their frontier garrisons. The [[Marquis de la Fayette]] took up command of the National Guard at Paris;&lt;ref&gt;Terry Crowdy, page 9 ''French Revolutionary Infantry 1789–1802'', ISBN 1-84176-660-7&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]] – leader of the Third Estate and instigator of the [[Tennis Court Oath]] – became the city's mayor under a new governmental structure known as the ''[[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Commune de Paris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[François Furet]] and Mona Ozouf, eds. ''A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution'' (1989), pp 519-28&lt;/ref&gt; The king announced that he would recall Necker and return from Versailles to Paris; on 17 July, in Paris, he accepted a [[Flag of France|tricolour]] [[cockade]] from Bailly and entered the Hôtel de Ville to cries of &quot;Long live the King&quot; and &quot;Long live the Nation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Sydenham, page 50 ''The French Revolution'', B. T. Batsford Ltd London 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, after this violence, nobles – little assured by the apparent and, as it was to prove, temporary reconciliation of king and people – started to flee the country as ''[[émigré]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Munro Price]], page 93 ''The Fall of the French Monarchy'', ISBN 0-330-48827-9&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first to leave were the comte d'Artois (the future [[Charles X of France]]) and his two sons, the [[Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé|prince de Condé]], the [[Louis François II, Prince of Conti|prince de Conti]], the [[Gabrielle de Polastron, duchesse de Polignac|Polignac]] family, and (slightly later) [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]], the former finance minister. They settled at [[Turin]], where Calonne, as agent for the count d'Artois and the prince de Condé, began plotting civil war within the kingdom and agitating for a European coalition against France.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Cobb]] and Colin James, page 129 ''The French Revolution. Voices From a Momentous Epoch 1789–1795'', CN 8039 Guild Publishing 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The news of the successful insurrection at Paris spread throughout France. In accord with principles of [[popular sovereignty]] and with complete disregard for claims of royal authority, the people established parallel structures of municipalities for civic government and militias for civic protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colin James page 75&quot;/&gt; In rural areas, many went beyond this: some burned title-deeds and no small number of châteaux, as the &quot;[[Great Fear]]&quot; spread across the countryside during the weeks of 20 July to 5 August, with attacks on wealthy landlords impelled by the belief that the aristocracy was trying to put down the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Sydenham, page 54 ''The French Revolution'', B. T. Batsford Ltd London 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Cobb]] and Colin James, page 77 ''The French Revolution. Voices From a Momentous Epoch 1789–1795'', CN 8039 Guild Publishing 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, 1789 the populace lynched [[Joseph Foullon de Doué]] and his son-in-law&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Sydenham, page 55 ''The French Revolution'', B. T. Batsford Ltd London 1965&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Bénigne François Bertier de Sauvigny]]. Both held official positions under the monarchy.

Although there were arguments that the Bastille should be preserved as a monument to liberation or as a depot for the new National Guard, the Permanent Committee of Municipal Electors at the Paris Town Hall gave the construction entrepreneur [[Pierre-François Palloy]] the commission of disassembling the building.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 412 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt; Palloy commenced work immediately. The demolition of the fortress itself, the melting down of its clock portraying chained prisoners, and the breaking up of four statues were all carried out within five months.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 414 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian composer [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf]] wrote his ''Symphony in C Major'' as a tribute to the event. The first movement of the piece is known as ''La Prise De La Bastille''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In Book 2 of Charles Dickens' ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', the Defarges help lead the assault on the Bastille.

In 1790, [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] gave the cast-iron, one-pound and three-ounce key to the Bastille to American President [[George Washington]]. Washington displayed it prominently at government facilities and events in New York and in Philadelphia until shortly before his retirement in 1797. The key remains on display at Washington's residence of [[Mount Vernon]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Women's March on Versailles01.jpg|thumb|right|400px|An illustration of the Women's March on Versailles, 5 October 1789]]
'''The Women's March on Versailles''', also known as '''The October March''', '''The October Days''', or simply '''The March on Versailles''', was one of the earliest and most significant events of the [[French Revolution]]. The march began among women in the marketplaces of Paris who, on the morning of 5 October 1789, were near rioting over the high price and scarcity of bread. Their demonstrations quickly became intertwined with the activities of revolutionaries, who were seeking liberal political reforms and a [[constitutional monarchy]] for France. The market women and their various allies grew into a mob of thousands. Encouraged by revolutionary agitators, they ransacked the city armory for weapons and marched to the [[Palace of Versailles]]. The crowd besieged the palace, and in a dramatic and violent confrontation, they successfully pressed their demands upon [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]]. The next day, the crowd compelled the king, his family, and most of the French [[National Constituent Assembly|Assembly]] to return with them to Paris.

These events  ended the king's independence and signified the change of power and reforms about to overtake France. The march symbolized a new balance of power that displaced the ancient privileged orders of the [[French nobility]] and favored the nation's common people, collectively termed the [[Estates of the realm#Estates in the Kingdom of France|Third Estate]]. Bringing together people representing [[Causes of the French Revolution|sources of the Revolution]] in their largest numbers yet, the march on Versailles proved to be a defining moment of that Revolution.

==Background==
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The revolutionary decrees passed by the Assembly in August 1789 culminated in [[The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].]]

The [[deregulation]] of the grain market implemented by [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], [[Louis XVI]]'s [[Controller-General of Finances]], in 1774, was the main cause of the famine which led to the [[Flour War]] in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Avery Hunt, ''The challenge of the West: Peoples and cultures from 1560 to the global age'', p.672, D. C. Heath, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[Ancien Régime]], the fear of famine became an ever-present dread for the lower strata of the Third Estate, and rumors of the &quot;[[Pacte de Famine]]&quot; to starve the poor were still rampant and readily believed.&lt;ref name=Doyle121&gt;Doyle, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Mere rumors of food shortage led to the [[Réveillon riots]] in April 1789. Rumors of a plot aiming to destroy wheat crops in order to starve the population provoked the [[Great Fear]] in the summer of 1789.

When the October ''journées''{{Ref|fn_a|a}} took place, France's revolutionary decade, 1789–1799, had barely begun. The revolution's capacity for violence was as yet not fully realized. The [[storming of the Bastille]] had occurred less than three months earlier. Flush with newly discovered power, the common citizens of France – particularly in the teeming capital, Paris – felt a newly discovered desire to participate in politics and government. The poorest among them were almost exclusively concerned with the issue of food: most workers spent nearly half their income on bread. In the post-Bastille period, price inflation and severe shortages in Paris became commonplace, as did local incidents of violence in the marketplaces.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The king's court and the deputies of the [[National Constituent Assembly]] were all in comfortable residence at the royal city of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], where they were considering momentous changes to the French political system. Reformist deputies had managed to pass sweeping legislation in the weeks after the Bastille's fall, including the revolutionary [[August Decrees]] (which formally abolished most noble and clerical privileges) and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, pp.129–130.&lt;/ref&gt; Now their attention was turned to the creation of a permanent constitution. Monarchists and conservatives of all degrees had thus far been unable to resist the surging strength of the reformers, but by September their positions were beginning, however slightly, to improve. In constitutional negotiations they were able to secure a legislative [[veto]] power for the king. Many of the reformers were left aghast by this, and further negotiations were hobbled by contentiousness.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, pp. 43ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quiet Versailles, the seat of royal power, was a stifling environment for reformers. Their stronghold was in Paris. The bustling metropolis lay within walking distance, less than {{convert|21|km}} to the northeast. The reformist deputies were well aware that the four hundred or more monarchist deputies were working to transfer the Assembly to the distant royalist city of [[Tours]], a place even less hospitable to their efforts than Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Worse, many feared that the king, emboldened by the growing presence of royal troops, might simply dissolve the Assembly, or at least renege on the August decrees. The king was indeed considering this, and when on 18 September he issued a formal statement giving his approval to only a portion of the decrees, the deputies were incensed.&lt;ref name=Doyle121&gt;Doyle, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Stoking their anger even further, the king even stated on 4 October that he had reservations about the Declaration of the Rights of Man.&lt;ref name=Doyle121/&gt;

=== Early plans ===
Despite its post-revolutionary mythology, the march was not a spontaneous event.&lt;ref name=Kropotkin152&gt;Kropotkin, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous calls for a mass demonstration at Versailles had already been made; the [[Marquis]] of [[Saint-Huruge]], one of the popular orators of the [[Palais-Royal]], had called for just such a march in August to evict the obstructionist deputies who, he claimed, were protecting the king's veto power.&lt;ref name=Doyle120&gt;Doyle, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his efforts were foiled, revolutionaries continued to hold onto the idea of a march on Versailles to compel the king to accept the Assembly's laws.&lt;ref name=Doyle120/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers at the Palais-Royal mentioned it regularly throughout the next month,&lt;ref&gt;Furet &amp; Ozouf, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; creating enduring suspicions of the proprietor, [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]].&lt;ref name=Morris242&gt;Morris, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a march on Versailles was widespread, and was even discussed in the pages of the ''[[Mercure de France]]'' (5 September 1789).&lt;ref name=Kropotkin152/&gt; A menacing unrest was in the air,&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt; and many nobles and foreigners fled the oppressive atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Lefebvre128&gt;Lefebvre, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Royal banquet ===
Following the mutiny of the [[French Guards]] a few hours before the storming of the Bastille, the only troops immediately available for the security of the palace at Versailles were the aristocratic [[Garde du Corps (France)|Garde du Corps]] (Body Guard) and the [[Swiss Guards|Cent-Suisses]] (Hundred Swiss). Both were primarily ceremonial units and lacked the numbers and training to provide effective protection for the royal family and the government. Accordingly, the Flanders Regiment (a regular infantry regiment of the Royal Army) was ordered to Versailles in late September 1789 by the king's minister of war, the [[François-Emmanuel Guignard, comte de Saint-Priest|Comte de Saint-Priest]], as a precautionary measure.&lt;ref name=Schama459&gt;Schama, p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October, the officers at Versailles held a welcoming banquet for the officers of the new troops, a customary practice when a unit changed its garrison. The royal family briefly attended the affair, walking amongst the tables set up in the opera house of the palace. Outside, in the ''cour de marbre'' (central courtyard), the soldiers' toasts and oaths of fealty to the king grew more demonstrative as the night wore on.&lt;ref name=Lefebvre128/&gt;

The lavish banquet was certain to be an affront to those suffering in a time of severe austerity, but it was reported in the ''[[L'Ami du peuple]]'' and other firebrand newspapers as nothing short of a gluttonous orgy. Worst of all, the papers all dwelt scornfully on the reputed desecration of the tricolor [[cockade]]; drunken officers were said to have stamped upon this symbol of the nation and professed their allegiance solely to the white cockade of the [[House of Bourbon]]. This embellished tale of the royal banquet became the source of intense public outrage.&lt;ref name=Schama459/&gt;

==Beginning of the march==
[[File:MarchWomenVersailles5-6october1789.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The women hailed by onlookers on their way to Versailles (illustration c.&amp;nbsp;1842)]]
On the morning of 5 October, a young woman struck a marching drum at the edge of a group of market-women who were infuriated by the chronic shortage and high price of bread. From their starting point in the markets of the eastern section of Paris then known as the [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine]], the angry women forced a nearby church to toll its bells.&lt;ref name=Hibbert97/&gt; Their numbers continued to grow and with restless energy the group began to march. More women from other nearby marketplaces joined in, many bearing kitchen blades and other makeshift weapons, as the tocsins rang from church towers throughout several districts.&lt;ref name=Doyle121/&gt; Driven by a variety of agitators, the mob converged on the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|''Hôtel de Ville'']]{{Ref|fn_b|b}} where they demanded not only bread, but arms.&lt;ref name=Doyle121/&gt; As more and more women – and men – arrived, the crowd outside the city hall reached between six and seven thousand,&lt;ref name=Schama460&gt;Schama, p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps as many as ten thousand.&lt;ref name=Morris242/&gt;

One of the men was the audacious [[Stanislas-Marie Maillard]],&lt;ref name=Schama461&gt;Schama, p.461.&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent [[Storming of the Bastille#Storming the Bastille|''vainqueur'']] of the Bastille,&lt;ref name=Soboul156&gt;Soboul, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; who eagerly snatched up his own drum and led the infectious cry of ''&quot;à Versailles!&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Maillard was a popular figure among the market-women,&lt;ref name=Schama461/&gt; and by unofficial acclamation was given a leadership role. Although hardly a gentle man,{{Ref|fn_c|c}} Maillard helped suppress by force of character the mob's worst instincts; he rescued the ''Hôtel de Ville'''s quartermaster, Pierre-Louis Lefebvre-Laroche, a priest commonly known as ''Abbé Lefebvre'', who had been strung up on a lamppost for trying to safeguard its gun powder storage.&lt;ref name=Schama461/&gt; The ''Hôtel de Ville'' itself was ransacked as the crowd surged through taking its provisions and weapons, but Maillard helped prevent it from burning down the entire building. In due course, the rioters' attention turned again to Versailles, and they filtered back to the streets. Maillard deputized a number of women as group leaders and gave a loose sense of order to the proceedings as he led the crowd out of the city in the driving rain.&lt;ref name=Lefebvre128/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle, pp. 249–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

As they left, thousands of [[National Guard (France)|National Guardsmen]] who had heard the news were assembling at the ''[[Place de Grève]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], in Paris as their commander-in-chief, discovered to his dismay that his soldiers were largely in favor of the march and were being egged on by agitators to join in. Even though he was one of France's greatest war heroes, Lafayette could not dissuade his troops and they began threatening to desert. Rather than see them leave as another anarchic mob, the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Parisian municipal government]] told Lafayette to guide their movements; they also instructed him to request that the king return voluntarily to Paris to satisfy the people. Sending a swift horseman forward to warn Versailles, Lafayette contemplated the near mutiny of his men: he was aware that many of them had openly promised to kill him if he did not lead or get out of the way.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp. 461–462.&lt;/ref&gt; At four o'clock in the afternoon, fifteen thousand guards with several thousand more civilian latecomers set off for Versailles. Lafayette reluctantly took his place at the head of their column, hoping to protect the king and public order.&lt;ref name=Schama462&gt;Schama, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kropotkin156&gt;Kropotkin, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals of the march==
The hunger and despair of the market women was the original impetus for the march,&lt;ref name=Soboul155&gt;Soboul, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; but what started as a search for bread soon took on a much more ambitious goal. The ''Hôtel de Ville'' had already opened its plentiful stores to the rioters, but they remained unsatisfied: they wanted not just one meal but the assurance that bread would once again be plentiful and cheap. Famine was a real and ever-present dread for the lower strata of the Third Estate, and rumors of an [[Pacte de Famine|&quot;aristocrats' plot&quot;]] to starve the poor were rampant and readily believed.&lt;ref name=Doyle121/&gt;

At the same time, there was common resentment against the reactionary attitudes prevailing in Court circles&lt;ref name=Schama460/&gt; even before the uproar sparked by the notorious banquet precipitated the political aspects of the march.&lt;ref name=Soboul155/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Deeper planners in the crowd spread the word that the king needed to dismiss his royal bodyguards entirely and replace them all with patriotic National Guardsmen, a line of argument that had a compelling resonance among Lafayette's soldiers.&lt;ref name=Schama461/&gt;

These two popular goals coalesced around a third that was largely the revolutionaries' idea, which was that the king and his court, and the Assembly as well, must all be moved to Paris to reside among the people. Only then would the foreign soldiers be expelled, food be reliably available, and France served by a leader who was &quot;in communion with his own people&quot;. The plan appealed to all segments of the crowd. Even those who were innocently supportive of the monarchy (and there were many among the women) felt the idea of bringing home ''le bon papa'' was a good and comforting plan. For revolutionaries, the preservation of their recent legislation and the creation of a constitution were paramount, and a lockdown of the king within reformist Paris would provide the best possible environment for the Revolution to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Soboul, pp.154–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Siege of the palace ==
[[File:Map of Versailles in 1789 by William R Shepherd (died 1934).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] in 1789]]
The crowd traveled the distance from Paris to Versailles in about six hours. Among their makeshift weaponry they dragged along several cannons taken from the ''Hôtel de Ville''.&lt;ref name=Doyle121/&gt; Boisterous and energetic, they recruited (or impressed into service) more and more followers as they surged out of Paris in the autumn rain. In their ambiguous but always aggressive ''poissard'' slang,{{Ref|fn_d|d}} they chattered enthusiastically about bringing the king back home.&lt;ref name=Schama456&gt;Schama, pp. 456–457.&lt;/ref&gt; Less affectionately, they spoke of the queen, [[Marie Antoinette]], and many had no restraint in calling for her death.&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, p.155.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occupation of the Assembly ===
When the crowd finally reached Versailles, it was met by another group that had assembled from the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=Schama462/&gt; Members of the Assembly greeted the marchers and invited Maillard into their hall, where he fulminated about the Flanders Regiment and the people's need for bread. As he spoke, the restless Parisians came pouring into the Assembly and sank exhausted on the deputies' benches. Hungry, fatigued, and bedraggled from the rain, they seemed to confirm that the siege was a simple demand for food. The unprotected deputies had no choice but to receive the marchers, who shouted down most of the speakers and demanded to hear from the popular reformist deputy [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The great orator declined this chance at demagoguery but nonetheless mingled familiarly with the market women, even sitting for some time with one of them upon his knee.&lt;ref name=Hibbert99&gt;Hibbert, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; A few other deputies welcomed the marchers warmly, including [[Maximilien Robespierre]] who was still at that time a relatively obscure figure in politics. Robespierre gave strong words of support to the women and their plight, and his efforts were received appreciatively; his solicitations helped greatly to soften the crowd's hostility towards the Assembly.&lt;ref name=Scurr93&gt;Scurr, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deputation to the king ===
With few other options available to him, the President of the Assembly, [[Jean Joseph Mounier]], accompanied a deputation of market-women into the palace to see the king.&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle pp. 257–258.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schama465&gt;Schama, p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt; A group of six women nominated by the crowd were escorted into the king's apartment, where they told him of the crowd's privations. The king responded sympathetically, and using all his charm impressed the women to the point that one of them fainted at his feet.&lt;ref name=Hibbert99/&gt; After this brief but pleasant meeting, arrangements were made to disburse some food from the royal stores, with more promised,&lt;ref name=Lefebvre133&gt;Lefebvre, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; and some in the crowd felt that their goals had been satisfactorily met.&lt;ref name=Schama465/&gt; As rain once again began to pelt Versailles, Maillard and a small cluster of market women trooped triumphantly back to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the crowd, however, remained unpacified. They milled around the palace grounds with rumors abounding that the women's deputation had been duped – the queen would inevitably force the king to break any promises that had been made.&lt;ref name=Hibbert101&gt;Hibbert, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Well aware of the surrounding dangers, Louis discussed the situation with his advisors. At about six o'clock in the evening, the king made a belated effort to quell the rising tide of insurrection: he announced that he would accept the August decrees and the Declaration of the Rights of Man without qualification.&lt;ref name=Schama465/&gt; Adequate preparations to defend the palace were not made, however: the bulk of the royal guards, who had been deployed under arms in the main square for several hours facing a hostile crowd, was withdrawn to the far end of the park of Versailles. In the words of one of the officers: &quot;Everyone was overwhelmed with sleep and lethargy, we thought it was all over.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Mansel, page 129 &quot;Pillars of Monarchy&quot;, ISBN 0-7043-2424-5&lt;/ref&gt; This left only the usual night guard of sixty-one ''Gardes du Corps'' posted throughout the palace.

Late in the evening, Lafayette's national guardsmen approached up the ''Avenue de Paris''. Lafayette immediately left his troops and went to see the king, grandly announcing himself with the declaration, &quot;I have come to die at the feet of Your Majesty&quot;.&lt;ref name=Schama466&gt;Schama, p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside, an uneasy night was spent in which his Parisian guardsmen mingled with the marchers, and the two groups sounded each other out. Many in the crowd persuasively denounced Lafayette as a traitor, complaining of his resistance to leaving Paris and the slowness of his march.&lt;ref name=Hibbert102/&gt; By the first light of morning, an alliance of the national guards and the women was evident, and as the crowd's vigor was restored, their roughneck ''poissard'' clamoring resumed.&lt;ref name=Carlyle267&gt;Carlyle, p.267.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bed Lodewijk XIV.jpg|thumb|left|140px|The king's bedchamber at the [[Palace of Versailles]]]]

=== Attack on the palace ===
At about six o'clock in the morning, some of the protesters discovered a small gate to the palace was unguarded. Making their way inside, they searched for the queen's bedchamber. The royal guards raced throughout the palace, bolting doors and barricading hallways and those in the compromised sector, the ''cour de marbre'', fired their guns at the intruders, killing a young member of the crowd.&lt;ref name=Hibbert101/&gt; Infuriated, the rest surged towards the breach and streamed inside.&lt;ref name=Carlyle272&gt;Carlyle, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two guardsmen, Miomandre and Tardivet, each separately attempted to face down the crowd and were overpowered.&lt;ref name=Carlyle272/&gt; {{Ref|fn_e|e}} The violence boiled over into savagery as Tardivet's head was shorn off and raised aloft on a [[Pike (weapon)|pike]].&lt;ref name=Schama467&gt;Schama, p.467.&lt;/ref&gt; As battering and screaming filled the halls around her, the queen ran barefoot with her ladies to the king's bedchamber and spent several agonizing minutes banging on its locked door, unheard above the din.&lt;ref name=Schama467/&gt; In a close brush with death, they barely escaped through the doorway in time.&lt;ref name=Carlyle272/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schama467/&gt;

The chaos continued as other royal guards were found and beaten; at least one more was killed and his head too appeared atop a pike.&lt;ref name=Carlyle273&gt;Carlyle, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the fury of the attack subsided enough to permit some communication between the former French Guards, who formed the professional core of Lafayette's National Guard militia, and the royal ''gardes du corps''. The units had a history of cooperation and a military sense of mutual respect, and Lafayette, who had been snatching a few hours of sleep in his exhaustion, awoke to make the most of it. To the relief of the royals, the two sets of soldiers were reconciled by his charismatic mediation and a tenuous peace was established within the palace.&lt;ref name=Carlyle273/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schama, pp.467–468.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marquis de Lafayette 1.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|The Marquis de Lafayette]] (1757–1834)]]

=== Lafayette's intervention ===
Although the fighting ceased and the two commands of troops had cleared the palace, the mob was still everywhere outside. The rank and file of both the Flanders Regiment and another regular unit present, the Montmorency Dragoons, now appeared unwilling to act against the people.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cobb, page 88 &quot;The French Revolution - Voices From a Momentous Epoch&quot;, CN 8039&lt;/ref&gt; Lafayette, who had earned the court's indebtedness, convinced the king to address the crowd. When the two men stepped out on a balcony an unexpected cry went up: &quot;''Vive le Roi!''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; The relieved king briefly conveyed his willingness to return to Paris, acceding &quot;to the love of my good and faithful subjects&quot;. As the crowd cheered, Lafayette stoked their joy by dramatically pinning a tricolor cockade to the hat of the king's nearest bodyguard.&lt;ref name=Schama468&gt;Schama, p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Fayette and Marie Antoinette 6th october 1789.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Lafayette at the balcony with [[Marie Antoinette]]]]
After the king withdrew, the exultant crowd would not be denied the same accord from the queen, and her presence was demanded loudly. Lafayette brought her to the same balcony, accompanied by her young son and daughter. The crowd ominously shouted for the children to be taken away, and it seemed the stage might be set for a regicide. Yet, as the queen stood with her hands crossed over her chest, the crowd – some of whom had muskets leveled in her direction – warmed to her courage. Amid this unlikely development, Lafayette cannily let the mob's fury drain away until, with dramatic timing and flair, he knelt reverently and kissed her hand. The demonstrators responded with a muted respect, and many even raised a cheer which the queen had not heard for quite a long time: ''&quot;Vive la Reine!&quot;''&lt;ref name=Schama468/&gt;

The goodwill generated by this surprising turn of events defused the situation, but to many observers the scene on the balcony was mere theatricality without long-term resonance.&lt;ref name=Soboul156/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kropotkin156/&gt; However pleased it may have been by the royal displays, the crowd insisted that the king come back with them to Paris.&lt;ref name=Soboul156/&gt;

=== Return to Paris ===
At about one o'clock in the afternoon of 6 October 1789, the vast throng escorted the royal family and a complement of one hundred deputies back to the capital, this time with the armed National Guards leading the way.&lt;ref name=Soboul156/&gt; By now the mass of people had grown to over sixty thousand, and the return trip took about nine hours.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The procession could seem merry at times, as guardsmen hoisted up loaves of bread stuck on the tips of their bayonets, and some of the market women rode gleefully astride the captured cannon.&lt;ref name=Lefebvre133/&gt; Yet, even as the crowd sang pleasantries about their &quot;Good Papa&quot;, their violent mentality could not be misread; celebratory gunshots flew over the royal carriage and some marchers even carried pikes bearing the heads of the slaughtered Versailles guards.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of victory over the ''[[Ancien Régime in France|''ancien régime'']]'' was imbued in the parade, and it was understood by all that the king was now fully at the service of the people.&lt;ref name=Kropotkin157&gt;Kropotkin, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1822 Tuileries Paris.png|thumb|right|The [[Tuileries Palace]], located deep in the city beside the [[Seine River]], was a dark and uncomfortable residence for the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
No one understood this so viscerally as the king himself. After arriving at the dilapidated [[Tuileries Palace]], abandoned since the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], he was asked for his orders and he replied with uncharacteristic diffidence, &quot;Let everyone put himself where he pleases!&quot; Then, with a sullen poignancy, he asked for a history of the deposed [[Charles I of England]] to be brought from the library.&lt;ref name=Kropotkin157/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Procedure-Criminelle-Versailles-1789 01.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Lawsuit about the happenings of 6 October at Versailles; Châtelet Paris 1790]]
The rest of the National Constituent Assembly followed the king within two weeks to new quarters in Paris. In short order, the entire body settled in only a few steps from the Tuileries at a former riding school, the ''[[Salle du Manège]]''.&lt;ref name=Soboul156/&gt; However, some fifty-six ''monarchien'' deputies did not come with them, believing the mob threat in the capital to be personally dangerous.&lt;ref name=Rose48/&gt; The October ''journées'' thus effectively deprived the monarchist faction of significant representation in the Assembly&lt;ref name=Soboul157&gt;Soboul, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; as most of these deputies retreated from the political scene; many, like [[Jean Joseph Mounier|Mounier]], fled the country altogether.&lt;ref name=Soboul157/&gt;

Conversely, Robespierre's impassioned defense of the march raised his public profile considerably. The episode gave him a lasting heroic status among the ''poissardes'' and burnished his reputation as a patron of the poor. His later rise to become virtual dictator of the Revolution was greatly facilitated by his actions during the occupation of the Assembly.&lt;ref name=Scurr93/&gt;

Lafayette, though initially acclaimed, found that he had tied himself too closely to the king. As the Revolution progressed, he was hounded into exile by the radical leadership. Maillard returned to Paris with his status as a local hero made permanent. He participated in several later ''journées'', but in 1794 became stricken with illness, dying at the age of thirty-one.&lt;ref&gt;Sorel, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; For the women of Paris, the march became the source of apotheosis in revolutionary hagiography. The &quot;Mothers of the Nation&quot; were highly celebrated upon their return, and they would be praised and solicited by successive Parisian governments for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

King Louis XVI was officially welcomed to Paris with a respectful ceremony held by mayor [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]]. His return was touted as a momentous turning point in the Revolution, by some even as its end. Optimistic observers such as [[Camille Desmoulins]] declared that France would now enter a new golden age, with its revived citizenry and popular constitutional monarchy.&lt;ref name=Soboul157/&gt; Others were more wary, such as journalist [[Jean-Paul Marat]], who wrote:
{{quote
|It is a source of great rejoicing for the good people of Paris to have their king in their midst once again. His presence will very quickly do much to change the outward appearance of things, and the poor will no longer die of starvation. But this happiness would soon vanish like a dream if we did not ensure that the sojourn of the Royal Family in our midst lasted until the Constitution was ratified in every aspect. ''L'Ami du Peuple'' shares the jubilation of its dear fellow citizens, but it will remain ever vigilant.
|'''''L'Ami du Peuple''''' #7 (1789)&lt;ref name=Soboul157/&gt;
}}

It would take almost two full years until the [[French Constitution of 1791|first French Constitution]] was signed on 3 September 1791, and it required another popular intervention to make it happen. Louis attempted to work within the framework of his limited powers after the women's march but won little support, and he and the royal family remained virtual prisoners in the Tuileries. Desperate, he made his abortive [[flight to Varennes]] in June 1791. Attempting to escape and join up with royalist armies, the king was once again captured by a mixture of citizens and national guardsmen who hauled him back to Paris. Permanently disgraced, Louis was forced to accept a constitution more denuding of his kingship than any previously put forward. The spiral of decline in the king's fortunes culminated at the [[guillotine]] in 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, pp. 123ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orléanist conspiracy theory ===
Even while the women were marching, suspicious eyes looked upon [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], already behind the July uprisings, as being somehow responsible for the event. The Duke, a cousin of Louis XVI, was an energetic proponent of constitutional monarchy, and it was an open secret that he felt himself to be uniquely qualified to be king under such a system. Though allegations of his specific actions concerning the October march remain largely unproven, he has long been considered a significant instigator of the events.&lt;ref name=Rose48&gt;Rose, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp.97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke was certainly present as a deputy to the Assembly, and he was described by contemporaries as smiling warmly as he walked among the protesters at the height of the siege; many of them are said to have hailed him with greetings like &quot;Here is our king! Long live King Orléans!&quot;&lt;ref name=Hibbert102&gt;Hibbert, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars believe that the Duke paid [[Agent provocateur|''agents provocateurs'']] to fan the discontent in the marketplaces and to conflate the women's march for bread with the drive to bring the king back to Paris.&lt;ref name=Hibbert97&gt;Hibbert, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest he coordinated in some way with Mirabeau, the Assembly's most powerful statesman at the time, to use the marchers to advance the constitutionalist agenda.&lt;ref name=Lefebvre132&gt;Lefebvre, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others go so far as to assert that the crowd was guided by such important [[Orléanist]] allies as [[Antoine Barnave]], [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos|Choderlos de Laclos]], and the [[Armand, duc d'Aiguillon|duc d'Aiguillon]], all dressed as ''poissardes'' in women's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet most of the Revolution's foremost histories describe any involvement of the Duke as ancillary to the action, efforts of opportunism that neither created nor defined the October march.{{Ref|fn_f|f}} The Duke was investigated by the crown for complicity and none was proven.&lt;ref name=Gershoy131&gt;Gershoy, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the pall of suspicion helped convince him to take on Louis XVI's offer of a diplomatic mission conveniently outside the country.&lt;ref name=Rose48/&gt; He returned to France the following summer and resumed his place in the Assembly where both he and Mirabeau were officially exonerated of any misdeeds regarding the march.&lt;ref name=Gershoy131/&gt; As the Revolution moved forward into [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]], the Duke's royal lineage and alleged avarice convicted him in the minds of radical leaders and he was sent to his execution in November 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, p.253.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The women's march was a signal event of the French Revolution, its impact on par with the fall of the Bastille.&lt;ref name=Kropotkin157/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, pp. 33ff.&lt;/ref&gt; For its inheritors, the march would stand as an inspirational example, emblematic of the power of popular movements. The occupation of the deputies' benches in the Assembly created a template for the future, forecasting the [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]] that would frequently influence successive Parisian governments.&lt;ref name=Kropotkin156/&gt; But it was the crudely decisive invasion of the palace itself that was most momentous; the attack removed forever the aura of invincibility that once cloaked the monarchy. It marked the end of the king's resistance to the tide of reform, and he made no further open attempts to push back the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; As one historian states, it was &quot;one of those defeats of royalty from which it never recovered&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kropotkin156/&gt;

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=24em}}
* {{note|fn_a| a:}} ''Journée'' (literally, &quot;[events of the] day&quot;) is used frequently in French accounts of the Revolution to denote any episode of popular uprising: thus the women's march is known most commonly in French as the &quot;October Days&quot;. English historians have favored more descriptive names for the episodes, and the majority (see Doyle, Schama, Hibbert, Wright, Dawson, ''et al.'') employ some variation of the phrase &quot;women's march&quot; in recognition of the market women's prominence as the vanguard of the action.
* {{note|fn_b| b:}} The Paris [[City hall (administration)|City Hall]], located on the ''Place de Grève'' which was renamed ''[[Place de l'Hôtel de Ville]]'' in 1802.
* {{note|fn_c| c:}} Carlyle repeatedly refers to him as &quot;cunning Maillard&quot; or &quot;shifty Maillard&quot;.
* {{note|fn_d| d:}} ''Poissarde'' (plural ''poissardes''), literally &quot;[[fishwife]]&quot;, was a contemporary general term for women of the working class. Derived from the French ''poix'' (pitch, tar), it is synonymous with their highly stylized urban slang.&lt;ref name=Schama456/&gt;
* {{note|fn_e| e:}} Miomandre was left for dead but survived to become a royalist hero. Schama's index gives his full name as François Aimé Miomandre de Sainte-Marie. Carlyle gives the second guard's name as Tardivet du Repaire.
* {{note|fn_f| f:}} Some writers, such as Hibbert and Webster, impute significant influence to the Duke; most authoritative historians of the Revolution give him much less emphasis. Lefebvre and Soboul describe Orléanist activity as garden-variety political manœuvres that would have been ineffective without the compelling economic circumstances that motivated the commoners. Carlyle, Michelet, and Rose paint his influence as shadowy and malign, but without resonant success. Schama and Doyle, by their absence of focus, depict him as largely irrelevant to the situation.

[[File:Berthault - Das Volk von Paris vor dem Rathaus.jpg|thumb|[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris]] during the French Revolution]]
The '''Paris Commune''' during the [[French Revolution]] was the government  of Paris from 1789 until 1795. Established in the ''[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]'' just after the [[storming of the Bastille]], it consisted of 144 delegates elected by the 48 divisions of the city. The Paris Commune became insurrectionary in the summer of 1792, essentially refusing to take orders from the central French government.   It took charge of routine civic functions but is best known for mobilizing extreme views and actions among the people and sponsoring the [[September Massacres]] of over 1000 priests and other prisoners, and for its campaign to dechristianize the churches and the people.  It lost much power in 1794 and was replaced in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;François Furet and Mona Ozouf, eds. ''A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution'' (1989), pp 519-28&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first mayor was [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]]; he was succeeded on November 1791 by [[Pétion de Villeneuve]] after Bailly's unpopular use of the [[French National Guard|National Guard]] to disperse a riotous assembly in the [[Champ de Mars Massacre|Champ de Mars]] (17 July 1791).

In 1792, the Commune was dominated by those [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] who were not in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] due to the [[Self-denying Ordinance (French Revolution)|Self-Denying Ordinance]].

On the night of 9 August 1792 a new revolutionary Commune, led by [[Georges Danton]], [[Camille Desmoulins]] and [[Jacques Hébert]] took possession of the ''Hôtel de Ville''; the next day insurgents assailed the [[Tuileries]], where the royal family resided. During the ensuing constitutional crisis, the collapsing Legislative Assembly of France was heavily dependent on the Commune for the effective power that allowed it to continue to function as a legislature. The all-powerful Commune demanded custody of the royal family, imprisoning them in the [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]] fortress. A list of &quot;opponents of the Revolution&quot; was drawn up, the gates to the city were sealed, and on 28 August the citizens were subjected to domiciliary visits, ostensibly in a search for muskets. By the evening of the 31st, every prison in Paris was full to overflowing, and on 2 September, with a wave of rumors and fears, the Commune ordered the [[September massacres]] in which over 1200 prisoners (200 of them Catholic priests) were massacred. 

It was not until 1792 that the government had a formal cabinet in place, with the appointment of the [[Ministers of the French National Convention]] and the decision of the [[Commissioners of the Committee of Public Safety]] in 1794 to take charge of administrative departments.

The government of the republic was succeeded by the [[French Directory]] in November of 1795.
