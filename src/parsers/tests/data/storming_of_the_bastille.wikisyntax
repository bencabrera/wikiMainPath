The '''Storming of the Bastille''' ({{lang-fr|Prise de la Bastille}} {{IPA-fr|pʁiz də la bastij|}}) occurred in [[Paris]], [[France]], on the afternoon of 14 July 1789. The medieval [[fortress]], [[armory]], and [[political prison]] in Paris known as the [[Bastille]] represented royal authority in the center of Paris. The prison contained just seven inmates at the time of its storming but was a symbol of the abuse of the monarchy; its fall was the [[Flashpoint (politics)|flashpoint]] of the [[French Revolution]].

In France, ''Le quatorze juillet'' (14 July) is a public holiday, usually called [[Bastille Day]] in English.

==Background==
During the reign of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], France faced a major [[inflation|economic crisis]], partially initiated by the cost of intervening in the [[France in the American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], and exacerbated by a [[Regressive tax|regressive system of taxation]].<ref>[[Simon Schama]], pages 60-71 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref> On 5 May 1789, the [[Estates-General of 1789]] convened to deal with this issue, but were held back by archaic protocols and the conservatism of the [[Estates of the realm#In France|Second Estate]], consisting of the nobility and amounting to only 2% of France's population at the time.<ref name="ReferenceB">[[Simon Schama]], page 402 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref> On 17 June 1789, the [[Estates of the realm#In France|Third Estate]], with its representatives drawn from the commoners, reconstituted themselves as the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], a body whose purpose was the creation of a French constitution. The king initially opposed this development, but was forced to acknowledge the authority of the assembly, which subsequently renamed itself the [[National Constituent Assembly]] on 9 July.<ref name="M. J. Sydenham page 46">M. J. Sydenham, page 46 ''The French Revolution'', B. T. Batsford Ltd London 1965</ref>

The commoners had formed the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]], sporting ''tricolour'' [[cockade]]s (''cocardes'') of blue, white and red, formed by combining the red and blue cockade of [[Paris]] and the white cockade of the king. These cockades, and soon simply their colour scheme, became the symbol of the revolution and, later, [[Tricouleur|of France itself]].<ref>[[Georges Lefebvre]], page 114 ''The Coming of the French Revolution'', ISBN 9780691121888</ref>

Paris, close to insurrection and, in [[François Mignet]]'s words, "intoxicated with liberty and enthusiasm",<ref name="Mignet, History..., Chapter I">{{harvnb|Mignet|1824|loc=§Chapter I}}</ref> showed wide support for the Assembly. The press published the Assembly's debates; political debate spread beyond the Assembly itself into the public squares and halls of the capital. The [[Palais-Royal]] and its grounds became the site of an ongoing meeting.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], pages 370-371 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref> The crowd, on the authority of the meeting at the Palais-Royal, broke open the [[Prison de l'Abbaye|prisons of the ''Abbaye'']] to release some grenadiers of the [[Gardes Françaises|French guards]], reportedly imprisoned for refusing to fire on the people.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], page 371 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref> The Assembly recommended the imprisoned guardsmen to the clemency of the king; they returned to prison, and received pardon. The rank and file of the regiment, previously considered reliable, now leaned toward the popular cause.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], page 375  ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref>

==Necker's dismissal==
On 11 July 1789, with troops at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], [[Sèvres]], the [[Champ de Mars]], and [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], Louis XVI, acting under the influence of the conservative nobles of his [[privy council]], dismissed and banished his finance minister, [[Jacques Necker]], who had been sympathetic to the Third Estate, and completely reconstructed the ministry.<ref>[[Munro Price]], pages 85-87 ''The Fall of the French Monarchy'', ISBN 0-330-48827-9</ref> The marshals [[Victor-François, 2nd duc de Broglie|Victor-François, duc de Broglie]], [[la Galissonnière]], the [[Paul François de Quelen, duc de la Vauguyon|duc de la Vauguyon]], the Baron [[Louis Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil|Louis de Breteuil]], and the intendant [[Foulon]], took over the posts of [[Louis Pierre de Chastenet de Puységur|Puységur]], [[Armand Marc, comte de Montmorin]], [[César Guillaume de La Luzerne|La Luzerne]], [[François-Emmanuel Guignard, comte de Saint-Priest|Saint-Priest]], and Necker.
[[File:Jacquesnecker.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Jacques Necker]] (1732–1804), French minister of finance]]

News of Necker's dismissal reached Paris in the afternoon of Sunday, 12 July. The Parisians generally presumed that the dismissal marked the start of a coup by conservative elements.<ref>[[Munro Price]], page 85 ''The Fall of the French Monarchy'', ISBN 0-330-48827-9</ref>  Liberal Parisians were further enraged by the fear that a concentration of Royal troops, brought to Versailles from frontier garrisons, would attempt to shut down the [[National Constituent Assembly]], which was meeting in Versailles. Crowds gathered throughout Paris, including more than ten thousand at the Palais-Royal. [[Camille Desmoulins]] successfully rallied the crowd by "mounting a table, pistol in hand, exclaiming: '''Citizens, there is no time to lose; the dismissal of Necker is the knell of a [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre|Saint Bartholomew]] for patriots! This very night all the Swiss and German battalions will leave the [[Champ de Mars, Paris|Champ de Mars]] to massacre us all; one resource is left; to take arms''!'"<ref name="Mignet, History..., Chapter I" />

The Swiss and German regiments referred to were among the foreign [[mercenary]] troops who made up a significant portion of the pre-revolutionary [[Armée Française|Royal Army]], and were seen as being less likely to be sympathetic to the popular cause than ordinary French soldiers.<ref>[[Munro Price]], page 76 ''The Fall of the French Monarchy'', ISBN 0-330-48827-9</ref> By early July, approximately half of the 25,000 regular troops in Paris and Versailles were drawn from these foreign regiments. The French regiments included in the concentration appear to have been selected either because of the proximity of their garrisons to Paris or because their colonels were supporters of the reactionary "court party" opposed to reform.<ref name="M. J. Sydenham page 46"/>

During the public demonstrations that started on 12 July, the multitude displayed busts of Necker and of [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], then marching from the Palais Royal through the theater district before continuing westward along the boulevards. The crowd clashed with the Royal German Cavalry Regiment ("Royal-Allemand") between the  [[Place Vendôme]] and the [[Tuileries Palace]]. From atop the [[Champs-Élysées]], the Prince de Lambesc unleashed a cavalry charge that dispersed the remaining protesters at Place Louis XV—now [[Place de la Concorde]].<ref>Micah Alpaugh, "The Politics of Escalation in French Revolutionary Protest: Political Demonstrations, Nonviolence and Violence in the ''Grandes journees'' of 1789", ''French History'' (Fall 2009)</ref> The Royal commander, [[Pierre Victor Besenval de Bronstatt|Baron de Besenval]], fearing the results of a blood bath amongst the poorly armed crowds or defections among his own men, then withdrew the cavalry towards Sèvres.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], page 385 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref> Meanwhile, unrest was growing among the people of Paris who expressed their hostility against state authorities by attacking customs posts blamed for causing increased food and wine prices.<ref>[[Richard Cobb]] and Colin James, page 73 ''The French Revolution. Voices From a Momentous Epoch 1789–1795'', CN 8039 Guild Publishing 1988</ref> The people of Paris started to plunder any place where food, guns and supplies could be hoarded. That night, rumors spread that supplies were being hoarded at Saint-Lazare, a huge property of the clergy, which functioned as convent, hospital, school and even as a jail. An angry mob broke in and plundered the property, seizing 52 wagons of wheat, which were taken to the public market. That same day multitudes of people plundered many other places including weapon arsenals. The Royal troops did nothing to stop the spreading of social chaos in Paris during those days.<ref>{{cite book |author=Louis, Bergeron |title=Le Monde et son Histoire |location=Paris |year=1970 |page=Volume VII, Chapter VI }} Micah Alpaugh, "The Politics of Escalation in French Revolutionary Protest: Political Demonstrations, Nonviolence and Violence in the Grandes Journees of 1789", ''French History'' (2009)</ref>

==Armed conflict==
[[File:La Bastille 20060809.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Bastille|Bastille of Paris]] before the Revolution.]]
The regiment of [[Gardes Françaises]] (French Guards) formed the permanent garrison of Paris and, with many local ties, was favourably disposed towards the popular cause.<ref>Terry Crowdy, page 6 ''French Revolutionary Infantry 1789–1802'', ISBN 1-84176-660-7</ref>  This regiment had remained confined to its barracks during the initial stages of the mid-July disturbances. With Paris becoming the scene of a general riot, [[Charles Eugene, Prince of Lambesc]] (Marshal of the Camp, Proprietor of the Royal Allemand-Dragoons), not trusting the regiment to obey his order, posted sixty dragoons to station themselves before its dépôt in the [[Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin|Chaussée d'Antin]]. The officers of the French Guards made ineffectual attempts to rally their men. The rebellious citizenry had now acquired a trained military contingent. As word of this spread, the commanders of the royal forces encamped on the Champ de Mars became doubtful of the dependability of even the foreign regiments.<ref>[[Munro Price]], pages 96-97 ''The Fall of the French Monarchy'', ISBN 0-330-48827-9</ref> The future "Citizen King", [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe, duc d'Orléans]], witnessed these events as a young officer and was of the opinion that the soldiers would have obeyed orders if put to the test. He also commented in retrospect that the officers of the French Guards had neglected their responsibilities in the period before the uprising, leaving the regiment too much to the control of its [[non-commissioned officer]]s.<ref>Comments recorded in diary entries made by Louis-Philipp during 1789</ref> However, the uncertain leadership of [[Pierre Victor Besenval de Bronstatt|Besenval]] led to a virtual abdication of royal authority in central Paris. A "bourgeois militia" arose through the sixty voting districts of Paris to take control over the insurrection.<ref name="Colin James page 75">[[Richard Cobb]] and Colin James, page 75 ''The French Revolution. Voices From a Momentous Epoch 1789–1795'', CN 8039 Guild Publishing 1988</ref>

==Storming the Bastille (14 July 1789)==
On the morning of 14 July 1789, the city of Paris was in a state of alarm. The partisans of the Third Estate in France, now under the control of the Bourgeois Militia of Paris (soon to become Revolutionary France's National Guard), had earlier stormed the [[Les Invalides|Hôtel des Invalides]] without meeting significant opposition.<ref>[[Richard Cobb]] and Colin James, page 68 ''The French Revolution. Voices From a Momentous Epoch 1789–1795'', CN 8039 Guild Publishing 1988</ref> Their intention had been to gather the weapons held there (29,000 to 32,000 muskets, but without powder or shot). The commandant at the Invalides had in the previous few days taken the precaution of transferring 250 barrels of gunpowder to the Bastille for safer storage.<ref name="ReferenceC">[[Simon Schama]], page 399 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref>

At this point, the Bastille was nearly empty, housing only seven prisoners:<ref>''Civilisation: A Personal View'', Kenneth Clark, Penguin, 1987, p. 216</ref> four [[forgery|forgers]], two "lunatics" and one "deviant" aristocrat, the Comte de Solages (the [[Marquis de Sade]] had been transferred out ten days earlier).<ref name="ReferenceC"/> 
 
The cost of maintaining a garrisoned medieval fortress for so limited a purpose had led to a decision being made shortly before the disturbances began to replace it with an open public space.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], page 398 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref> Amid the tensions of July 1789 the building remained as a symbol of royal tyranny.

The regular garrison consisted of 82 ''invalides'' (veteran soldiers no longer suitable for service in the field).<ref>{{cite book|last=Connelly|first=Owen |authorlink=Owen Connelly |title=The Wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon 1792–1815|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=18}}</ref>  It had however been reinforced on 7 July by 32 grenadiers of the Swiss Salis-Samade Regiment from the regular troops on the Champ de Mars.<ref>Christopher J. Tozzi, pages 54 "Nationalizing France's Army. Foreign, Black and Jewish Troops in the French Military, 1715-1831, ISBN 978-0-8139-3833-2</ref> The walls mounted eighteen eight-pound guns and twelve smaller pieces. The governor was [[Bernard-René de Launay]], son of the previous governor and actually born within the Bastille.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

The official list of ''vainqueurs de la Bastille''  (conquerors of the Bastille) subsequently compiled has 954 names,<ref>[[Christopher Hibbert|Hibbert, Christopher]]. ''The French Revolution'' (1980), p. 82 (1982 Penguin Books edition)</ref> and the total of the crowd was probably fewer than one thousand. A breakdown of occupations included in the list indicates that the majority were local artisans, together with some regular army deserters and a few distinctive categories such as twenty-one wine merchants.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Simon Schama]], page 400 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref>

The crowd gathered outside around mid-morning, calling for the surrender of the prison, the removal of the cannon and the release of the arms and gunpowder.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], pages 399 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref>  Two representatives of the crowd outside were invited into the fortress and negotiations began, and another was admitted around noon with definite demands. The negotiations dragged on while the crowd grew and became impatient.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], page 400-401 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref> Around 1:30, the crowd surged into the undefended outer courtyard. A small party climbed onto the roof of a building next to the gate to the inner courtyard and broke the chains on the [[drawbridge]], crushing one unfortunate ''vainqueur'' as it fell. Soldiers of the garrison called to the people to withdraw but in the noise and confusion these shouts were misinterpreted as encouragement to enter.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Gunfire began, apparently spontaneously, turning the crowd into a mob. The crowd seems to have felt that they had been intentionally drawn into a trap and the fighting became more violent and intense, while attempts by deputies to organise a cease-fire were ignored by the attackers.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

The firing continued, and after 3 pm the attackers were reinforced by mutinous ''gardes françaises'', along with two cannons. A substantial force of Royal Army troops encamped on the Champs de Mars did not intervene.<ref>[[Munro Price]], page 89 ''The Fall of the French Monarchy'', ISBN 0-330-48827-9</ref> With the possibility of mutual carnage suddenly apparent, Governor de Launay ordered a cease-fire at 5 pm. A letter offering his terms was handed out to the besiegers through a gap in the inner gate. His demands were refused, but de Launay nonetheless capitulated, as he realised that with limited food stocks and no water supply<ref name="ReferenceA"/> his troops could not hold out much longer. He accordingly opened the gates to the inner courtyard, and the ''vainqueurs'' swept in to liberate the fortress at 5:30.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], page 403 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref>

Ninety-eight attackers and one defender had died in the actual fighting, a disparity accounted for by the protection provided to the garrison by the fortress walls.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], pages 403-404 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref> De Launay was seized and dragged towards the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] in a storm of abuse. Outside the Hôtel, a discussion as to his fate began.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], page 404 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref>  The badly beaten de Launay shouted "Enough! Let me die!"<ref>[[Simon Schama]], page 405 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref> and kicked a pastry cook named Dulait in the groin. De Launay was then stabbed repeatedly and died; his head was cut off and put on a [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] to be carried through the streets.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], page 404 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref> The three officers of the permanent Bastille garrison were also killed by the crowd; surviving police reports detail their wounds and clothing.<ref>[[J. B. Morton]], appendix ''The Bastille Falls: and other studies of the French Revolution'', Longmans, Green & Co, London 1936</ref>
Two of the ''invalides'' of the garrison were lynched, but all but two of the Swiss regulars of the Salis-Samade Regiment were protected by the French Guards and eventually released to return to their regiment. Their officer, Lieutenant Louis de Flue, wrote a detailed report on the defense of the Bastille, which was incorporated in the logbook of the Salis-Samade and has survived.<ref name="Révue Retrospective 1834">"Rélation de la prise de la Bastille le 14 juillet 1789 par un de ses défenseurs", in ''Révue Retrospective'', vol. 4 (Paris: M. J. Taschereau, 1834)</ref> It is (perhaps unfairly) critical of the dead Marquis de Launay, whom de Flue accuses of weak and indecisive leadership.<ref name="Révue Retrospective 1834"/> The blame for the fall of the Bastille would rather appear to lie with the inertia of the commanders of the 5,000<ref>Christopher Hibbert, page 70 ''The French Revolution'', ISBN 978-0140049459</ref> Royal Army troops encamped on the Champs de Mars, who did not act when either the nearby Hôtel des Invalides or the Bastille were attacked.

Returning to the Hôtel de Ville, the mob accused the ''prévôt ès marchands'' (roughly, mayor) [[Jacques de Flesselles]] of treachery, and he was assassinated en route to an ostensible trial at the [[Palais-Royal]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Days of the French Revolution |last=Hibbert |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Hibbert |year=1980 |publisher=William Morrow and Co. |location=New York |isbn=0-688-03704-6 |pages=69–82 }}</ref>

==Aftermath==

[[File:Colonne de Juillet 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Place de la Bastille]] and the [[July Column]] where the Bastille once stood.]]

The king first learned of the storming only the next morning through the [[François Alexandre Frédéric, duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt|Duke of La Rochefoucauld]]. "Is it a revolt?" asked Louis XVI. The duke replied: "No sire, it's not a revolt; it's a revolution."<ref>Guy Chaussinand-Nogaret, ''La Bastille est prise'', Paris, Éditions Complexe, 1988, p. 102.</ref>

The citizenry of Paris, expecting a counterattack, entrenched the streets, built barricades of paving stones, and armed themselves as well as they could, especially with improvised [[pike (weapon)|pikes]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Meanwhile, at Versailles, the Assembly remained ignorant of most of the Paris events, but eminently aware that Marshal de Broglie stood on the brink of unleashing a pro-Royalist coup to force the Assembly to adopt the order of 23 June<ref>{{cite web |accessdate= 22 January 2009 |url= http://sourcebook.fsc.edu/history/seance.html |title= The Séance royale of 23&nbsp;June 1789 |publisher= [[Fitchburg State College]] }}</ref> and then to dissolve. The [[Louis-Marie, vicomte de Noailles|vicomte de Noailles]] apparently first brought reasonably accurate news of the Paris events to Versailles. M. Ganilh and Bancal-des-Issarts, dispatched to the Hôtel de Ville, confirmed his report.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], pages 419-420 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref>

By the morning of 15 July, the outcome appeared clear to the king as well, and he and his military commanders backed down.<ref>[[Munro Price]], page 92 ''The Fall of the French Monarchy'', ISBN 0-330-48827-9</ref> The Royal troops concentrated around Paris dispersed to their frontier garrisons. The [[Marquis de la Fayette]] took up command of the National Guard at Paris;<ref>Terry Crowdy, page 9 ''French Revolutionary Infantry 1789–1802'', ISBN 1-84176-660-7</ref>  [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]] – leader of the Third Estate and instigator of the [[Tennis Court Oath]] – became the city's mayor under a new governmental structure known as the ''[[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Commune de Paris]]''.<ref>[[François Furet]] and Mona Ozouf, eds. ''A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution'' (1989), pp 519-28</ref> The king announced that he would recall Necker and return from Versailles to Paris; on 17 July, in Paris, he accepted a [[Flag of France|tricolour]] [[cockade]] from Bailly and entered the Hôtel de Ville to cries of "Long live the King" and "Long live the Nation".<ref>M. J. Sydenham, page 50 ''The French Revolution'', B. T. Batsford Ltd London 1965</ref>

Nonetheless, after this violence, nobles – little assured by the apparent and, as it was to prove, temporary reconciliation of king and people – started to flee the country as ''[[émigré]]s''.<ref>[[Munro Price]], page 93 ''The Fall of the French Monarchy'', ISBN 0-330-48827-9</ref> Among the first to leave were the comte d'Artois (the future [[Charles X of France]]) and his two sons, the [[Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé|prince de Condé]], the [[Louis François II, Prince of Conti|prince de Conti]], the [[Gabrielle de Polastron, duchesse de Polignac|Polignac]] family, and (slightly later) [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]], the former finance minister. They settled at [[Turin]], where Calonne, as agent for the count d'Artois and the prince de Condé, began plotting civil war within the kingdom and agitating for a European coalition against France.<ref>[[Richard Cobb]] and Colin James, page 129 ''The French Revolution. Voices From a Momentous Epoch 1789–1795'', CN 8039 Guild Publishing 1988</ref>

The news of the successful insurrection at Paris spread throughout France. In accord with principles of [[popular sovereignty]] and with complete disregard for claims of royal authority, the people established parallel structures of municipalities for civic government and militias for civic protection.<ref name="Colin James page 75"/> In rural areas, many went beyond this: some burned title-deeds and no small number of châteaux, as the "[[Great Fear]]" spread across the countryside during the weeks of 20 July to 5 August, with attacks on wealthy landlords impelled by the belief that the aristocracy was trying to put down the revolution.<ref>M. J. Sydenham, page 54 ''The French Revolution'', B. T. Batsford Ltd London 1965</ref><ref>[[Richard Cobb]] and Colin James, page 77 ''The French Revolution. Voices From a Momentous Epoch 1789–1795'', CN 8039 Guild Publishing 1988</ref>

On July 22, 1789 the populace lynched [[Joseph Foullon de Doué]] and his son-in-law<ref>M. J. Sydenham, page 55 ''The French Revolution'', B. T. Batsford Ltd London 1965</ref> [[Louis Bénigne François Bertier de Sauvigny]]. Both held official positions under the monarchy.

Although there were arguments that the Bastille should be preserved as a monument to liberation or as a depot for the new National Guard, the Permanent Committee of Municipal Electors at the Paris Town Hall gave the construction entrepreneur [[Pierre-François Palloy]] the commission of disassembling the building.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], page 412 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref> Palloy commenced work immediately. The demolition of the fortress itself, the melting down of its clock portraying chained prisoners, and the breaking up of four statues were all carried out within five months.<ref>[[Simon Schama]], page 414 ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', ISBN 0-670-81012-6</ref>

Austrian composer [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf]] wrote his ''Symphony in C Major'' as a tribute to the event. The first movement of the piece is known as ''La Prise De La Bastille''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In Book 2 of Charles Dickens' ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', the Defarges help lead the assault on the Bastille.

In 1790, [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] gave the cast-iron, one-pound and three-ounce key to the Bastille to American President [[George Washington]]. Washington displayed it prominently at government facilities and events in New York and in Philadelphia until shortly before his retirement in 1797. The key remains on display at Washington's residence of [[Mount Vernon]].<ref>
