'''Colored''' is a term used in the [[United States]], predominantly in the [[Southern United States|South]] during the racial segregation era, and the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; to describe people who were not categorized as &quot;[[White people|white]]&quot; or those with mixed racial heritage. Most commonly, the term was used to refer to [[black people]] (i.e., persons of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n [[ancestry]]; members of the African (or [[Negroid]]) [[Race (human categorization)|race]]). Since the success of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–68)|African-American Civil Rights Movement]], the term, along with &quot;[[negro]]&quot; and others, has been largely replaced by &quot;[[Black people|black]]&quot; and (in the US) &quot;[[African American]]&quot;. According to the [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary, the word ''colored'' was first used in the 14th Century, but with a meaning other than race or ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/colored |title=Colored &amp;#124; Definition of Colored by Merriam-Webster |website=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other English-speaking countries, the term – often spelled '''coloured'''&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot; /&gt; – has varied meanings. In [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]] , [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], the name [[coloured]] (often capitalized) refers both to a specific ethnic group of complex mixed origins, which is considered neither black nor white, and in other contexts (usually lower case) to people of mixed race. In [[United Kingdom|British]] usage, the term refers to &quot;a person who is wholly or partly of non-white descent&quot; and its use may be regarded as antiquated or offensive,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot;&gt;&gt;{{cite news|title=Is the word 'coloured' offensive?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6132672.stm|publisher=BBC News |work=Magazine|accessdate=August 18, 2012|date=November 9, 2006|quote=In times when commentators say the term is widely perceived as offensive, a Labour MP lost no time in condemning it &quot;patronising and derogatory&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of coloured in English|work=Oxford Dictionaries|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/coloured |accessdate=18 August 2012|quote=In Britain it was the accepted term until the 1960s, when it was superseded (as in the US) by black. The term coloured lost favour among black people during this period and is now widely regarded as offensive except in historical contexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other terms are preferable, particularly when referring to a single ethnicity.

==History in United States==
In 1851, an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to the &quot;colored population&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New York Times|page=3|date=September 18, 1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, the War Department established the [[Bureau of Colored Troops]]. 

The first 12 [[United States Census]] counts enumerated '&quot;colored&quot; people, who totaled nine million in 1900. The census counts of 1910–1960 enumerated &quot;negroes&quot;.

&quot;It's no disgrace to be colored&quot;, the black entertainer [[Bert Williams]] famously observed early in the century, &quot;but it is awfully inconvenient.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Neilly, Herbert L. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lMF8I4oHGZEC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=williams+%22It%E2%80%99s+no+disgrace+to+be+colored%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VsfhbvP6KF&amp;sig=y0dXJuWvhDlL9wYqfSOJ0PN5hPw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LcTyUMqUL8PG0QGSiYHwCQ&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=williams%20%22It%E2%80%99s%20no%20disgrace%20to%20be%20colored%22&amp;f=false Black Pride: The Philosophy and Opinions of Black Nationalism: A Six-Volume History of Black Culture in Two Parts] AuthorHouse, 2005; ISBN 1418416657, page 237 (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Colored people lived in three neighborhoods that were clearly demarcated, as if by ropes or turnstiles&quot;, wrote Harvard professor [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] about growing up in [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] [[West Virginia]] in the 1960s. &quot;Welcome to the Colored Zone, a large stretched banner could have said... Of course, the colored world was not so much a neighborhood as a condition of existence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GrowingUp&quot;&gt;Gates Jr, Henry Louis, [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/growing-colored Growing Up Colored], ''American Heritage Magazine'', Summer 2012, Volume 62, Issue 2&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;For most of my childhood, we couldn't eat in restaurants or sleep in hotels, we couldn't use certain bathrooms or try on clothes in stores&quot;, recalls Gates. His mother retaliated by not buying clothes she was not allowed to try on. He remembered hearing a white man deliberately [[Society for the Prevention of Calling Sleeping Car Porters &quot;George&quot;|calling his father by the wrong name]]. &quot;'He knows my name, boy,' my father said after a long pause. 'He calls all colored people George.'&quot; When Gates's cousin became the first black cheerleader at the local high school, she was not allowed to sit with the team and drink Coke from a glass, but had to stand at the counter drinking from a paper cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;GrowingUp&quot; /&gt; Professor Gates also wrote about his experiences in his 1995 book, ''Colored People: A Memoir''.&lt;ref&gt;Gates Jr, Henry Louis, ''Colored People: A Memoir'', (Vintage, 1995), ISBN 067973919X.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, &quot;colored&quot; is generally not regarded as a [[politically correct]] term.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=BarbaraPA|title=Politically correct term for black people|url=https://www.englishforums.com/English/PoliticallyCorrectTermBlack-People/zqxcx/post.htm|website=englishforums.com|accessdate=14 February 2015|quote=&quot;Colored&quot; is considered an old-fashioned term and slighly prejudiced.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Derogatory Racial Terms to Avoid in Public|url=http://racerelations.about.com/od/understandingrac1/a/racialnamestoavoid_2.htm|website=racerelations.about.com|publisher=About.com|accessdate=14 February 2015|quote=Some people may think it's okay to simply shorten that phrase [&quot;people of color&quot;] to &quot;colored,&quot; but they're mistaken. Like &quot;Oriental,&quot; &quot;colored&quot; harkens back to an era of exclusion, a time when Jim Crow was in full force, and blacks used water fountains marked &quot;colored&quot; and sat in the &quot;colored&quot; sections of busses, beaches and restaurants. In essence, the term stirs up painful memories.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term lives on in the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], generally called NAACP.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot; /&gt; In 2008 Carla Sims, its communications director, said &quot;the term 'colored' is not derogatory, [the NAACP] chose the word 'colored' because it was the most positive description commonly used [in 1909, when the association was founded]. It's outdated and antiquated but not offensive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2008/11/12/lohan-calls-obama-colored-naacp-says-no-big-deal#ftnb|title = Lohan calls Obama ‘colored’, NAACP says no big deal|publisher = Mercury News|date=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There has not been a movement to change the name of the organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3991">The '''SAT Subject Test in United States History''' is the name of a one-hour [[multiple choice]] [[Standardized test|test]] given on [[United States History]] by [[The College Board]]. A [[student]] chooses whether to take the test depending upon [[college]] entrance requirements for the schools in which the student is planning to apply. Until 1994, the [[SAT Subject Tests]] were known as '''Achievement Tests'''; and from 1995 until January 2005, they were known as '''SAT IIs'''. Of all SAT subject tests, United States History is taken the second most, with 119,903 administrations in 2009.&lt;ref name=SATsubjectpercentile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/SAT-Subject-Test-Percentile-Ranks-2009.pdf |title=SAT Subject Test Percentile Ranks, 2009 College-Bound Seniors |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |format=[[PDF]] |publisher=[[The College Board]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The test has 90 multiple choice questions that are to be answered in one hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAT Prep&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=SAT Subject Test in U.S. History Practice|url=http://sat.collegeboard.org/practice/sat-subject-test-preparation/us-history|publisher=The College Board|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All questions have five answer choices. Students' scores are based entirely on their performance in answering the multiple choice questions.

The questions cover a broad range of topics.  Approximately 31–35% of questions focus on [[political history]], 13–17% focus on [[Economic history of the United States|economic history]], 20–24% focus on [[social history]], 13–17% focus on [[Intellectual history|intellectual]] and [[Cultural history of the United States|cultural history]], and 13–17% focus on [[Foreign relations of the United States|foreign policy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SAT Prep&quot; /&gt;

The questions also vary with respect to time period; approximately 20% focus on period of the [[Pre-Columbian era]] to 1789, 40% focus on the period between 1790 and 1898, and 40% focus on the period between 1899 and the present day.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAT Prep&quot; /&gt;

== Scoring ==
For each of the multiple choice questions, students receive 1 point for every correct answer, lose {{frac|1|4}} of a point for each incorrect answer, and receive 0 points for questions left blank. This creates a ''raw score'', which is then converted into a ''scaled score''. The conversion between these numbers varies depending on the difficulty of a particular test administration. The ''scaled score'' is the only score reported to either students or colleges and ranges from 200 to 800, with 800 being the best possible score. The [[mean]] and [[standard deviation]] of the test scores in 2009 were 599 and 115, respectively.&lt;ref name=SATsubjectpercentile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/SAT-Subject-Test-Percentile-Ranks-2009.pdf |title=SAT Subject Test Percentile Ranks, 2009 College-Bound Seniors |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |format=[[PDF]] |publisher=[[The College Board]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
The College Board suggests as preparation for the test a year-long course in United States History at the college preparatory level.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAT Prep&quot; /&gt;  The test requires understanding of historical data and concepts, [[causality|cause and effect]] relationships, [[geography]], and the ability to effectively synthesize and interpret data from charts, maps, and other [[visual media]]. However, most questions from this test are derived from/similar to the [[AP US History]] Multiple Choice questions from 2014 and earlier (the 2015 exam has been revised). By taking an [[Advanced Placement Program|AP class]], IB History of the Americas, or a class with similar rigor, the chances at doing well on this test are much improved.

The '''United States Factor''' is a view of modern history that promotes the United States as the contingent reason for the [[Allied Powers]] winning both [[World War]]s and for preventing any powerful rival political regime from becoming mainstream in the 21st century world.

== Background ==

[[Azar Gat]], the author of the (arguably) seminal work on the history of warfare through the course of humanity, argues that this &quot;United States Factor&quot; is both widely overlooked and the reason for democracy's victory over totalitarianism in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gat2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gat|first=Azar|title=War in Human Civilization|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=565–567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the United States Factor notion, &quot;if it were not for the existence of the USA the liberal democracies would most probably have lost the great struggles of the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gat2006&quot; /&gt;

== United States Factor in History ==

The 20th century did appear to witness what many theorists have seen as the end of the battles of political ideology, with the political model of [[liberal democracy]] coming out on top. Indeed, [[political scientist]]s, including [[Francis Fukuyama]], hailed the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] as the &quot;end of history&quot; in which the ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy [becomes] the final form of human government.&quot; (See [[End of History and the Last Man]])

In the view of the United States Factor, this &quot;end of history&quot; is made possible only because the USA was in a unique space economically, geographically, politically, and militarily throughout the 20th century that made it possible for the United States to &quot;rescue&quot; the [[Old World]] powers from the threat of [[totalitarianism]]. These menaces included both right wing totalitarian regimes, such as [[Nazism]], as well as left wing totalitarianism—better known as Soviet-era Communism. (See [[State ideology of the Soviet Union]])

Though Gat acknowledges that the victory of democracy over totalitarianism was not necessarily &quot;preordained&quot; at the outset of either World War, he goes on to remark that the sheer fact that the USA existed gave liberal democracies their &quot;edge&quot; in the battle against totalitarian regimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gat2006&quot; /&gt; This was achieved mainly by the USA's contributions to the European Allies' war efforts from a distant location that was geographically large and politically united.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gat2006&quot; /&gt;

== American Exceptionalism ==

This is a view of modern history that fits within the political theory of [[American exceptionalism]]. American exceoptionalism, as defined by Jentleson, is a theory that holds that the United States possesses an inherent uniqueness and &quot;special virtue&quot; that is rooted in American principles and can be traced throughout American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jentleson|first=Bruce|title=American Foreign Policy: The Dynamics of Choice in the 21st Century|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-393-93357-4|pages=90–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that the United States is exceptional, or extraordinary, simply because it is the United States is a political philosophy that has been in existence for several decades and is a leading contributor to contemporary American political culture. (See [[Politics of the United States]])

There are many other ideas as to the behaviors of states and how they react and interact in the world. Such views that provide alternate theories to American exceptionalism and the United States Factor include [[Realism (international relations)|realism]], [[constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]], and [[idealism]], just to name a few. These are some of the popular theories used in today's discussions about International Relations. They put emphasis on states' behaviors and how to forecast potential outcomes of the entire spectrum of international affairs, from militarized conflict to diplomacy.

The '''American gentry''' were members of the [[American upper class]]es, particularly early in the settlement of the [[United States]].
[[File:Mtvernon1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Vernon]], [[Virginia]], was the [[plantation#Other types of plantation|plantation]] home of George Washington.]]
[[File:Washington 1787-1790.jpg|100px|thumb|left|[[George Washington]]]]
[[File:T Jefferson by Charles Willson Peale 1791 2.jpg|100px|thumb|left|[[Thomas Jefferson]]]][[Image:Thomas Jefferson's Monticello.JPG|thumb|alt=Jefferson's home, Monticello|[[Monticello]], in Virginia, was the estate of Thomas Jefferson.]]

The [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonial American]] use of ''[[gentry]]'' followed the British usage (i.e., [[landed gentry]]) before the independence of the United States. The [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] was commonly evidenced in land holdings by estate owners in Virginia, Maryland and the Carolinas. North of Maryland, there were few large compatible rural estates, except in the Dutch domains in the Hudson Valley of New York.

The families of Virginia (see [[First Families of Virginia]]) who formed the Virginia gentry class, such as General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s ancestors, were among the earliest settlers in Virginia. Lee's family of [[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall]] was considered among the oldest of the Virginia [[Gentleman#Robert E. Lee|gentry class]]. Lee's family is one of Virginia's first families, originally arriving in Virginia from England in the early 1600s with the arrival of [[Richard Lee I]], Esq., &quot;the Immigrant&quot; (1618–64), from the county of [[Shropshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother grew up at [[Shirley Plantation]], one of the most elegant homes in Virginia. His maternal great-great grandfather, [[Robert &quot;King&quot; Carter]] of [[Corotoman]], was the wealthiest man in [[Thirteen Colonies|the colonies]] when he died in 1732. 

[[Thomas Jefferson]], the patron of American [[agrarianism]], wrote in his ''Notes on Virginia'' (1785), &quot;Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God, if He ever had a chosen people, whose breasts He has made His peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue.&quot;  Jefferson who spent much of his childhood at [[Tuckahoe Plantation]] was a great-grandson of [[William Randolph]] a colonist and land owner who arrived in Virginia from England in the mid 1600s and played an important role in the history and government of the English colony of Virginia.

[[George Washington]], the first president of the United States was also the wealthiest man to ever hold the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/02/15/10-richest-presidents/5514567/|title=Report: The 10 richest U.S. presidents|newspaper=USA TODAY|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a commercial farmer much interested in innovations, and happily quit his public duties in 1783 and again in 1797 to manage his plantation at Mount Vernon. Washington lived an upper-class lifestyle—fox hunting was a favorite leisure activity enjoyed by gentry, worldwide. Like most planters in Virginia, Washington imported luxury items and other fine wares from England. He paid for them by exporting his tobacco crop. 

Extravagant spending and the unpredictability of the tobacco market meant that many Virginia planters financial resources were unstable. Thomas Jefferson was deeply in debt when he died and his heirs were forced to sell Monticello to cover his debts. In 1809, [[Henry Lee III]] went bankrupt and served one year in [[debtors' prison]] in [[Montross, Virginia]]; his son, Robert E. Lee was two years old at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/lee_henry.html|title= A Princeton Companion (Lee, Henry)|year=1978|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/lee_henry.html| title= Stratford Hall/Lee Family Tree: Henry Lee III|accessdate= 20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;Despondent and nearly broke, [[William Byrd III]] of [[Westover Plantation]] committed suicide in 1777. 

Wood notes that &quot;Few members of the American gentry were able to live idly off the rents of tenants as the English landed aristocracy did.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon S. Wood|title=The Radicalism of the American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6lGinKwz7l8C&amp;pg=PA113|year=2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some landowners, especially in the Dutch areas of upstate New York, leased out their lands to tenants, but generally —&quot;[[Plain Folk of the Old South]]&quot;— ordinary farmers owned their cultivated holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Charles C. Bolton, &quot;Planters, Plain Folk, and Poor Whites in the Old South.&quot; in Lacy K. Ford, ed., A Companion to the Civil War and Reconstruction, (2005) pp 75-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first families of Virginia and Maryland==

[[First Families of Virginia]] originated with colonists from England who primarily settled at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and along the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and other navigable waters in the [[Colony of Virginia]] during the 17th century. As there was a propensity to marry within their narrow social scope for many generations, many descendants bear surnames which became common in the growing colony.

Many of the original English colonists considered members of the First Families of Virginia migrated to the [[Colony of Virginia]] during the [[English Civil War]] and [[English Interregnum]] period (1642–1660). Royalists left England on the accession to power of Oliver Cromwell and his Parliament. Because most of Virginia's leading families recognized [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King following the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, Charles II is reputed to have called Virginia his &quot;Old Dominion&quot;, a nickname that endures today. The affinity of many early aristocratic Virginia settlers for the Crown led to the term &quot;distressed Cavaliers&quot;, often applied to the Virginia oligarchy. Many Cavaliers who served under King Charles I fled to Virginia. Thus, it came to be that FFVs often refer to Virginia as &quot;Cavalier Country&quot;. These men were offered rewards of land, etc., by King Charles II, but they had settled Virginia and so remained in Virginia.

Most of such early settlers in Virginia were so-called &quot;Second Sons&quot;.  [[Primogeniture]] favored the first sons' inheriting lands and titles in England. Virginia evolved in a society of second or third sons of English aristocracy who inherited [[land grant]]s or land in Virginia. They formed part of the southern elite in America.

Many of the great Virginia dynasties traced their roots to families like the [[Lee family|Lees]] and the Fitzhughs, who traced lineage to England's county families and baronial legacies. But not all: even the most humble Virginia immigrants aspired to the English manorial trappings of their betters. Virginia history is not the sole province of English aristocrats. Such families as the Shackelfords, who gave their name to a Virginia hamlet, rose from modest beginnings in Hampshire to a place in the Virginia firmament based on hard work and smart marriages. Some families like the  Gilliams arrived in Virginia in the 17th century as [[indentured servants]]. By the late 18th century through hard work and smart marriages the Gilliam family had risen from servitude to landed gentry having amassed several large plantations including [[Weston Manor]].  Families such as the [[Mathews family (Virginia)|Mathews]] from the later [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish immigration]] also formed political dynasties in Old Virginia. At the same time, other once-great families were decimated not only by the [[English Civil War]], but also by the enormous power of the London merchants to whom they were in debt and who could move markets with the stroke of a pen.

The Colonial families of Maryland (see [[Colonial families of Maryland]]) were the leading families in the [[Province of Maryland]]. Several also had interests in the [[Colony of Virginia]], and the two are sometimes referred to as the [[Chesapeake Colonies]]. Many of the early settlers came from the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] in England, although the Maryland families were composed of a variety of European nationalities, e.g., French, Irish, Welsh, Scottish, and Swedish, in addition to English.

The Carroll family is an example of a prominent political family from Maryland, of Irish descent and origin in the ancient kingdom of Éile, commonly anglicized Ely, as a branch of the ruling O'Carroll family. Another is the Mason family of Virginia, who descended from the progenitor of the Mason family, [[George Mason I]], a [[Cavalier]] member of the [[Parliament of England]] born in Worcestershire, England.  The Riggin family of Maryland who also had holdings on the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]] is of Irish descent and origin in the ancient [[kingdom of Meath]]. The surname is an anglicization of the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] Ó Riagáin. The Ó Riagáins were one of the families that made up the [[Four Tribes of Tara]], an alliance of powerful clans. The Four Tribes were one of the major defenders of Ireland against [[Viking]] invasions during the 8th and 9th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ireland-calling.com/irish-names-regan/|title=Regan – direct descendants of Brian Boru|newspaper=Ireland Calling|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ó Riagáins were chiefs of Hy-Riagain, now the barony of Tinnehinch in the [[County Laois|Queen's County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.libraryireland.com/Pedigrees1/Meath.php|title=Irish Chiefs and Clans in the County Meath|website=www.libraryireland.com|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles I of England]] granted the province [[County palatine|palatinate]] status under [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]]. The foundational charter created an aristocracy of [[lords of the manor]] for Maryland. Maryland was uniquely created as a colony for [[Catholic church|Catholic]] aristocracy and [[landed gentry]], but [[Anglicanism]] eventually came to dominate, partly through influence from neighboring Virginia.

[[David John Lewis|David Lewis]] (D-[[Maryland|MD]]).]]

The [[Social Security Act]] was enacted August 14, 1935. The Act was drafted during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term by the President's Committee on Economic Security, under [[Frances Perkins]], and passed by [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] as part of the [[New Deal]]. The Act was an attempt to limit what were seen as dangers in the modern American life, including old age, poverty, unemployment, and the burdens of widows and fatherless children. By signing this Act on August 14, 1935, President Roosevelt became the first president to advocate federal assistance for the elderly.&lt;ref name=Achenbaum&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew (1986). Social Security Visions and Revisions. New York: [[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 25-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act provided benefits to retirees and the unemployed, and a [[Lump sum|lump-sum]] benefit at death. Payments to current retirees are financed by a [[payroll tax]] on current workers' wages, half directly as a payroll tax and half paid by the employer. The act also gave money to states to provide assistance to aged individuals (Title I), for unemployment insurance (Title III), [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] (Title IV), Maternal and Child Welfare (Title V), public health services (Title VI), and the blind (Title X).&lt;ref name=Achenbaum/&gt;

==Origins and Design==
Early debates on Social Security's design centered on how the program's benefits should be funded. Some believed that benefits to individuals should be funded by contributions that they themselves had made over the course of their careers. Others argued that this design would disadvantage those who had already begun their careers at the time of the program's implementation because they would not have enough time to accumulate adequate benefits.&lt;ref name=Schieber&gt;{{cite book|last=Schieber|first=Sylvester|title=The Predictable Surprise: The Unraveling of the U.S. Retirement System|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0199890951|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial opposition===
Social Security was controversial when originally proposed, with one point of opposition being that it would reduce the labor force, but supporters argued instead that retiring older workers would free up employment for young men, which during the Depression was a vital point of concern.

Opponents also decried the proposal as [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Finance, Business, Economics: Huge Old-Age Reserve Fund Under Doughton Bill Gives Treasury Extensive New Financial Powers; Could Be Used to Control Credit Also |work= The Washington Post |date= April 25, 1935 |page= 23 |url= http://search.proquest.com.dclibrary.idm.oclc.org/docview/150734868/C716EECD728D4789PQ/15?accountid=46320 |quote= &quot;The social security bill, in its present form, is thus not only a sweeping piece of legislation, but also a far-reaching financial measure.

Most women and minorities were excluded from the benefits of [[unemployment insurance]] and [[old age pensions]].&lt;ref&gt;Mink, Gwendolyn (1995). ''The Wages of Motherhood: Inequality in the Welfare State, 1917–1942''. Ithaca: [[Cornell University Press]]. p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Job categories that were not covered by the act included workers in agricultural labor, domestic service, government employees, and many teachers, nurses, hospital employees, librarians, and social workers.&lt;ref&gt;Quadagno, Jill (1994). ''The Color of Welfare: How Racism Undermined the War on Poverty''. New York: [[Oxford University Press]]. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The act also denied coverage to individuals who worked intermittently.&lt;ref name=Kessler130&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice, 2001. pp. 130-1.&lt;/ref&gt; These jobs were dominated by women and minorities. For example, women made up 90 percent of domestic labor in 1940 and two-thirds of all employed black women were in domestic service.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice, 2001. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusions exempted nearly half of the working population.&lt;ref name=Kessler130/&gt; Nearly two-thirds of all African Americans in the labor force, 70 to 80 percent in some areas in the South, and just over half of all women employed were not covered by Social Security.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice, 2001. p.157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Katznelson&gt;Katznelson, Ira. ''When Welfare was White: The untold history of racial inequality in twentieth century America''. New York: W.W. Norton, 2005. pp. 43-8.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the [[NAACP]] protested the Social Security Act, describing it as “a sieve with holes just big enough for the majority of Negroes to fall through.”&lt;ref name=Katznelson/&gt;

Some textbooks have suggested that this discrimination resulted from the powerful position of [[Southern Democrats]] on two of the committees pivotal for the Act's creation, the [[Senate Finance Committee]] and the [[House Ways and Means Committee]]. However, Larry DeWitt has refuted those arguments, showing there was no evidence for them. Indeed, seven Democrats in 1935 were generally liberal and strongly supported of the New Deal and Social Security.  They became much more conservative after 1937. The Social Security law was very unpopular among many groups, especially farmers, who resented the additional taxes and feared they would never be made good. They lobbied hard for exclusion. Furthermore, the Treasury realized how difficult it would be to set up payroll deduction plans for farmers, for housekeepers who employed maids, and for nonprofit groups; therefore they were excluded. State employees were excluded for constitutional reasons (the federal government cannot tax state government). Federal employees were also excluded. Many textbooks, however, falsely indicate that the exclusions were the product of southern racial hostility toward blacks; there is no evidence of that in the record.&lt;ref&gt;Larry DeWitt, &quot;The Decision to Exclude Agricultural and Domestic Workers from the 1935 Social Security Act.&quot; ''Social Security Bulletin'' (2010) 70#4 pp: 49-68. [http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n4/v70n4p49.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Security reinforced traditional views of family life.&lt;ref name=Mink&gt;Mink, Gwendolyn. ''The Wages of Motherhood'', 1995. pp. 126-130.&lt;/ref&gt; Women generally qualified for benefits only through their husbands or children.&lt;ref name=Mink/&gt; Mothers’ pensions (Title IV) based entitlements on the presumption that mothers would be unemployed.&lt;ref name=Mink/&gt;

Historical discrimination in the system can also be seen with regard to [[Aid to Dependent Children]]. Since this money was allocated to the states to distribute, some localities assessed black families as needing less money than white families. These low grant levels made it impossible for African American mothers to not work: one requirement of the program.&lt;ref&gt;Mink, 1995, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states also excluded children born out of [[Marriage|wedlock]], an exclusion which affected African American women more than white women.&lt;ref&gt;Mink 1995, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; One study determined that 14.4% of eligible white individuals received funding, but only 1.5 percent of eligible black individuals received these benefits.&lt;ref name=Katznelson/&gt;

===Debates on the constitutionality of the Act===
In the 1930s, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] struck down many pieces of Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, including the [[Railroad Retirement Board|Railroad Retirement Act]].  The Social Security Act's similarity with the Railroad Retirement Act caused [[Edwin Witte]]- the executive director of the President's Committee on Economic Security under Roosevelt who was credited as &quot;the father of social security&quot;-&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jstor.org/pss/2520349&lt;/ref&gt; to question whether or not the bill would pass;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v18n10/v18n10p22.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; John Gall, an Associate Counsel for the National Association of Manufacturers who testified before the US House of Representatives in favor of the act, also felt that the bill was rushed through Congress too quickly and that the old age provision of the act was &quot;hodgepodge&quot; that needed to be written more properly in order to have a higher likelihood of being ruled constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/perkins6.html |title=Social Security Online |publisher=Ssa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court threw out a centerpiece of the New Deal, the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]], the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]], and New York State's [[minimum-wage]] law. President Roosevelt responded with an attempt to pack the court via the [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937]]. On February 5, 1937, he sent a special message to Congress proposing legislation granting the President new powers to add additional judges to all federal courts whenever there were sitting judges age 70 or older who refused to retire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourthistory.org/01_society/01.html Supremecourthistory.org] {{wayback|url=http://www.supremecourthistory.org/01_society/01.html |date=20081006175022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practical effect of this proposal was that the President would get to appoint six new Justices to the Supreme Court (and 44 judges to lower federal courts), thus instantly tipping the political balance on the Court dramatically in his favor. The debate on this proposal was heated and widespread, and lasted over six months. Beginning with a set of decisions in March, April, and May, 1937 (including the Social Security Act cases), the Court would sustain a series of New Deal legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/court.html |title=Social Security Administration |publisher=Ssa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] rulings affirmed the constitutionality of the Social Security Act.
* ''[[Steward Machine Company v. Davis]]'', 301 U.S, 548&lt;ref name=&quot;www.oyez.org.654&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=''Steward Machine Company vs. Davis'', 301 U.S, 548 |url=http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/368/ |accessdate=December 3, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128231948/http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/368/ |archivedate=November 28, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1937) held, in a 5–4 decision, that, given the exigencies of the [[Great Depression]], &quot;[It] is too late today for the argument to be heard with tolerance that in a crisis so extreme the use of the moneys of the nation to relieve the unemployed and their dependents is a use for any purpose narrower than the promotion of the [[Common good|general welfare]]&quot;. The arguments opposed to the Social Security Act (articulated by justices [[Pierce Butler (justice)|Butler]], [[James Clark McReynolds|McReynolds]], and [[George Sutherland|Sutherland]] in their opinions) were that the social security act went beyond the powers that were granted to the federal government in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. They argued that, by imposing a tax on employers that could be avoided only by contributing to a state [[Unemployment benefit|unemployment-compensation]] fund, the federal government was essentially forcing each state to establish an unemployment-compensation fund that would meet its criteria, and that the federal government had no power to enact such a program.
* ''[[Helvering v. Davis]]'', 301 U.S. 619 (1937), decided on the same day as ''Steward'', upheld the program because &quot;The proceeds of both [employee and employer] taxes are to be paid into the Treasury like internal-revenue taxes generally, and are not earmarked in any way&quot;. That is, the Social Security Tax was constitutional as a mere exercise of Congress's general taxation powers.

==Implementation==
Payroll taxes were first collected in 1937, also the year in which the first benefits were paid, namely the lump-sum death benefit paid to 53,236 beneficiaries.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The first reported Social Security payment was to Ernest Ackerman, a Cleveland motorman who retired only one day after Social Security began.&lt;ref name= ackerman&gt;{{cite news |title= First Age Pension Yields Beneficiary Profit of 12 Cents |work= Associated Press |publisher= The Washington Post |date= January 8, 1937 |page= 9 |url= http://search.proquest.com.dclibrary.idm.oclc.org/docview/150950134/25B9EF92FA924B1BPQ/1?accountid=46320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five cents were withheld from his pay during that period, and he received a lump-sum payout of seventeen cents from Social Security.&lt;ref name= ackerman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/history/briefhistory3.html#firstcheck First Payments of Social Security], Social Security Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first monthly payment was issued on January 31, 1940 to [[Ida May Fuller]] of [[Ludlow (town), Vermont|Ludlow]], [[Vermont]].&lt;ref name= fuller&gt;{{cite news |title= Ida May Fuller, 100, of Vermont, Received First Social Security Check: Classmate of Calvin Coolidge |work= The Washington Post |date= January 31, 1975 |page= C4 |url= http://search.proquest.com.dclibrary.idm.oclc.org/docview/146227490/52A59E1A61574AFFPQ/7?accountid=46320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, 1938, and 1939, she paid a total of $24.75 into the Social Security System. Her first check was for $22.54.&lt;ref name= fuller/&gt; After her second check, Fuller already had received more than she contributed over the three-year period. She ultimately reached her 100th birthday, dying in 1975&lt;ref name= fuller/&gt; and she collected a total of $22,888.92.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/idapayroll.html Research Note #3: Details of Ida May Fuller's Payroll Tax Contributions], Social Security Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion and evolution==
{{Further|List of Social Security legislation (United States)}}
The provisions of Social Security have been changing since the 1930s, shifting in response to economic worries as well as concerns over changing gender roles and the position of minorities. Officials have responded more to the concerns of women than those of minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Social Security gradually moved toward universal coverage. By 1950, debates moved away from which occupational groups should be included to how to provide more adequate coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in Social Security have reflected a balance between promoting equality and efforts to provide adequate protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot;&gt;Achenbaum 1986. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, benefits paid totaled $35 million. These rose to $961 million in 1950, $11.2 billion in 1960, $31.9 billion in 1970, $120.5 billion in 1980, and $247.8 billion in 1990 (all figures in nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation). In 2004, $492 billion of benefits were paid to 47.5 million beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/pdf/2007historybooklet.pdf p. 19] {{wayback|url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/pdf/2007historybooklet.pdf |date=20091229061211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, nearly 51 million Americans received $650 billion in Social Security benefits.

The effects of Social Security took decades to manifest themselves. In 1950, it was reported that as many as 40% of Americans over 65 were still employed in some capacity, but by 1980 that figure had dropped to less than 20%. In 1990, fewer than 11% of Americans over 65 were still employed, an all-time low after which the number began to slowly rise again.

During the 1950s, over-65s continued to have the highest poverty rate of any age group in the US with the largest percentage of the nation's wealth concentrated in the hands of Americans under 35. By 2010, this figure had dramatically reversed itself with the largest percentage of wealth being in the hands of Americans aged 55–75 and those under 45 being among the poorest. Elder poverty, once a normal sight, had thus become rare by the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/17/AR2006031702088.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===1939 Amendment===

====Economic concerns====
One reason for the proposed changes in 1939 was a growing concern over the impact that the reserves created by the 1935 act were having on the economy. The [[Recession of 1937]] was blamed on the government, tied to the abrupt decrease in government spending and the $2 billion that had been collected in Social Security taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum 1986, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits became available in 1940 instead of 1942 and changes to the benefit formula increased the amount of benefits available to all recipients in the early years of Social Security.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum 1986, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; These two policies combined to shrink the size of the reserves. The original Act had conceived of the program as paying benefits out of a large reserve. This Act shifted the conception of Social Security into something of a hybrid system; while reserves would still accumulate, most early beneficiaries would receive benefits on the pay-as-you-go system.
Just as importantly, the changes also delayed planned rises in contribution rates. Ironically if these had been left in place they would have come into effect during the wartime boom in wages and would have arguably helped to temper wartime inflation.&lt;ref&gt;Berstein, Merton and Joan (1988). ''Social Security: The System That Works''. New York City: [[Basic Books]]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Creation of the Social Security Trust Fund====
The amendments established a [[Social Security Trust Fund|trust fund]] for any surplus funds. The managing [[trustee]] of this fund is the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]. The money could be invested in both non-marketable and marketable [[securities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/history/BudgetTreatment SSA.gov], budget treatment {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The move toward family protection====
Calls for reform of Social Security emerged within a few years of the 1935 Act. Even as early as 1936, some believed that women were not getting enough support. Worried that a lack of assistance might push women back into the work force, these individuals wanted Social Security changes that would prevent this. In an effort to protect the family, therefore, some called for reform which tied women's aid more concretely to their dependency on their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;Mink, Gwendolyn. ''The Wages of Motherhood'', 1995. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Others expressed apprehension about the complicated administrative practices of Social Security.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions''. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about the size of the reserve fund of the retirement program, emphasized by a recession in 1937, led to further calls for change.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum 1986, pp. 27, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

These amendments, however, avoided the question of the large numbers of workers in excluded categories.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the amendments of 1939 made family protection a part of Social Security. This included increased federal funding for the [[Aid to Dependent Children]] and raised the maximum age of children eligible to receive money under the Aid to Dependent Children to 18. The amendment added wives, elderly widows, and dependent survivors of covered male workers to those who could receive [[old age pensions]]. These individuals had previously been granted lump-sum payments upon only death or coverage through the Aid to Dependent Children program. If a married wage-earning woman’s own benefit was worth less than 50% of her husband’s benefit, she was treated as a wife, not a worker.&lt;ref&gt;Mink, Gwendolyn. ''The Wages of Motherhood'', 1995. pp. 135-6.&lt;/ref&gt; If a woman who was covered by Social Security died, however, her dependents were ineligible for her benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Since support for widows was dependent on the husband being a covered worker, African American widows were severely underrepresented and unaided by these changes.&lt;ref&gt;Mink, Gwendolyn. ''The Wages of Motherhood'', 1995. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to assure fiscal conservatives who worried about the costs of adding family protection policies, the benefits for single workers were decreased and lump-sum death payments were abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

====FICA====
[[File:SocialSecurityposter2.gif|thumb|A poster for the expansion of the Social Security Act]]
In the original 1935 law, the benefit provisions were in Title II of the Act (which is why Social Security is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Title II&quot; program.) The taxing provisions were in a separate title (Title VIII) (for reasons related to the [[Social Security (United States)#Debates on the constitutionality of the Act|constitutionality of the 1935 Act]]).  As part of the 1939 Amendments, the Title VIII taxing provisions were taken out of the Social Security Act and placed in the Internal Revenue Code and renamed the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|Federal Insurance Contributions Act]] (FICA).  Social Security payroll taxes are thus often referred to as &quot;FICA taxes.&quot;

===Amendments of the 1950s and 60s===
After years of debates about the inclusion of domestic labor, household employees working at least two days a week for the same person were added in 1950, along with nonprofit workers and the self-employed. Hotel workers, laundry workers, all agricultural workers, and state and local government employees were added in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris 2001. p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the tax rate was raised to 4.0 percent (2.0 percent for the employer, 2.0 percent for the employee) and disability benefits were added. Also in 1956, women were allowed to retire at 62 with benefits reduced by 25 percent. Widows of covered workers were allowed to retire at 62 without the reduction in benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris 2001, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BrochureUSSocialSecurity1961Pages1and4FormOAAN7006.jpg|thumb|Brochure from 1961 with basic advice about Social Security cards (pages 1 and 4)]]
[[File:BrochureUSSocialSecurity1961Pages2and3FormOAAN7006.jpg|thumb|Same brochure (pages 2 and 3)]]
In 1961, retirement at age 62 was extended to men, and the tax rate was increased to 6.0%.

In 1962, the changing role of the female worker was acknowledged when benefits of covered women could be collected by dependent husbands, widowers, and children. These individuals, however, had to be able to prove their [[Dependant (law)|dependency]].&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] were added in 1965 by the [[Social Security Act of 1965]], part of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s &quot;[[Great Society]]&quot; program.

In 1965, the age at which widows could begin collecting benefits was reduced to 60. Widowers were not included in this change. When [[divorce]], rather than death, became the major cause of marriages ending, divorcées were added to the list of recipients. Divorcées over the age of 65 who had been married for at least 20 years, remained unmarried, and could demonstrate dependency on their ex-husbands received benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government adopted a [[unified budget]] in the Johnson administration in 1968. This change resulted in a single measure of the fiscal status of the government, based on the sum of all government activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/BudgetTreatment.html |title=SSA.gov |publisher=SSA.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surplus in Social Security trust funds offsets the total [[debt]], making it appear much smaller than it otherwise would. This allowed Congress to increase spending without having to risk the political consequences of raising taxes.

===Amendments of the 1970s===

====1972 Amendments====
In June 1972, both houses of the [[United States Congress]] approved by overwhelming majorities 20% increases in benefits for 27.8 million Americans. The average payment per month rose from $133 to $166. The bill also set up a [[cost-of-living]] adjustment (COLA) to take effect in 1975. This adjustment would be made on a yearly basis if the [[Consumer Price Index]] (CPI) increased by 3% or more.&lt;ref name=achenbaum58&gt;Achenbaum 1986. p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; This addition was an attempt to index benefits to [[inflation]] so that benefits would rise automatically. If inflation was 5%, the goal was to automatically increase benefits by 5% so their real value didn't decline. A technical error in the formula caused these adjustments to overcompensate for inflation, a technical mistake which has been called double-indexing. The COLAs actually caused benefits to increase at twice the rate of inflation.

In October 1972, a $5 billion piece of Social Security legislation was enacted which expanded the Social Security program. For example, minimum monthly benefits of individuals employed in low income positions for at least 30 years were raised. Increases were also made to the pensions of 3.8 million widows and dependent widowers.&lt;ref name=achenbaum58/&gt;

These amendments also established the [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI). SSI is not a Social Security benefit, but a welfare program, because the elderly and disabled poor are entitled to SSI regardless of work history. Likewise, SSI is not an entitlement, because there is no right to SSI payments.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, during the phase-in period of Social Security, Congress was able to grant generous benefit increases because the system had perpetual short-run surpluses. Congressional amendments to Social Security took place in even numbered years (election years) because the bills were politically popular, but by the late 1970s, this era was over. For the next three decades, projections of Social Security's finances would show large, long-term deficits, and in the early 1980s, the program flirted with immediate insolvency. From this point on, amendments to Social Security would take place in odd numbered years (years that were not election years) because Social Security reform now meant tax increases and benefit reductions. Social Security became known as the &quot;Third Rail of American Politics.&quot; Touching it meant political death.

Several effects came together in the years following the 1972 amendments which rapidly changed the outlook on Social Security's long-term financial picture from positive to problematic. By the 1970s, the phase-in period, during which workers were paying taxes but few were collecting benefits, was largely over, and the ratio of elderly population to the working population was increasing. These developments brought questions about the capacity of the long term financial structure based on a pay-as-you-go program.

During the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, the economy suffered double-digit inflation, coupled with very high [[interest rates]], oil and energy crises, high unemployment and slow [[economic growth]]. [[Productivity growth]] in the United States had declined to an average annual rate of 1%, compared to an average annual rate increase of 3.2% during the 1960s. There was also a growing federal budget [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] which increased to $66 billion. The 1970s are described as a period of [[stagflation]], meaning economic stagnation coupled with price inflation, as well as higher interest rates. Price inflation (a rise in the general level of prices) creates uncertainty in budgeting and planning and makes labor strikes for pay raises more likely.
These underlying negative trends were exacerbated by a colossal mathematical error made in the 1972 amendments establishing the COLAs. The mathematical error which overcompensated for inflation was particularly detrimental given the double-digit inflation of this period, and the error led to benefit increases that were nowhere near financially sustainable.

The high inflation, double-indexing, and lower than expected wage growth was financial disaster for Social Security.

====1977 Amendments====
To combat the declining financial outlook, in 1977 Congress passed and Carter signed legislation fixing the double-indexing mistake. This amendment also altered the tax formulas to raise more money,&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum 1986, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; increasing withholding from 2% to 6.15%.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 324&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|coauthors= |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 324|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With these changes, President Carter remarked, &quot;Now this legislation will guarantee that from 1980 to the year 2030, the Social Security funds will be sound.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sylvester J. Schieber and John. B. Shoven, ''The Real Deal: the History and Future of Social Security''. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1999), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; This turned out not to be the case. The financial picture declined almost immediately and by the early 1980s, the system was again in crisis.

=== 1983 Amendments ===
After the 1977 amendments, the economic assumptions surrounding Social Security projections continued to be overly optimistic as the program moved toward a crisis. For example, COLAs were attached to increases in the CPI. This meant that they changed with prices, instead of wages. Before the 1970s, wage measurements exceeded changes in price. In the 1970s, however, this reversed and real wages decreased. This meant that FICA revenues could not keep up with the increasing benefits that were being given out. Continued high unemployment levels also lowered the amount of Social Security tax that could be collected. These two developments were decreasing the Social Security Trust Fund reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, projections indicated that the Social Security Trust Fund would run out of money by 1983, and there was talk of the system being unable to pay benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvester J. Schieber and John. B. Shoven, ''The Real Deal'', 1999, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Commission on Social Security Reform, chaired by [[Alan Greenspan]], was created to address the crisis.

The National Commission on Social Security Reform (NCSSR), chaired by [[Alan Greenspan]], was empaneled to investigate the long-run solvency of Social Security. The 1983 Amendments to the SSA were based on the NCSSR's Final Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the National Commission on Social Security Reform |url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/gspan.html |accessdate= March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCSSR recommended enacting a six-month delay in the COLA and changing the tax-rate schedules for the years between 1984 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew. ''Social Security Visions and Revisions'', 1986. p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; It also proposed an income tax on the Social Security benefits of higher-income individuals. This meant that benefits in excess of a household income threshold, generally $25,000 for singles and $32,000 for couples (the precise formula computes and compares three different measures) became taxable. These changes were important for generating revenue in the short term.

Also of concern was the long-term prospect for Social Security because of demographic considerations. Of particular concern was the issue of what would happen when people born during the [[post–World War II baby boom]] retired. The NCSSR made several recommendations for addressing the issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ssa.gov.656&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Chapter 2 of the 1983 Greenspan Commission on Social Security Reform | url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/gspan5.html | accessdate=March 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 1983 amendments to Social Security, a previously enacted increase in the payroll tax rate was accelerated, additional employees were added to the system, the full-benefit retirement age was slowly increased, and up to one-half of the value of the Social Security benefit was made potentially taxable income.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ssa.gov.657&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Research Notes &amp; Special Studies by the Historian's Office | url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/taxationofbenefits.html | accessdate=March 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social Security Trust Fund ====
{{POV section|date=February 2011}} The 1983 Amendments also included a provision to exclude the [[Social Security Trust Fund]] from the [[unified budget]] (to take it “[[off-budget]].”{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}) Yet today Social Security is treated like all the other trust funds of the Unified Budget.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

As a result of these changes, particularly the tax increases, the Social Security system began to generate a large short-term surplus of funds, intended to cover the added retirement costs of the &quot;[[baby boomer]]s.&quot; Congress invested these surpluses into special series, non-marketable U.S. [[Treasury securities]] held by the Social Security Trust Fund. Under the law, the government bonds held by Social Security are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

==The Supreme Court and the evolution of Social Security==
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has established that no one has any legal right to Social Security benefits. The Court decided, in ''[[Flemming v. Nestor]]'' (1960), that &quot;entitlement to Social Security benefits is not a contractual right&quot;. In that case, Ephram Nestor, a Bulgarian immigrant to the United States who made contributions for covered wages for the statutorily required &quot;quarters of coverage&quot; was nonetheless denied benefits after being deported in 1956 for being a member of the Communist party.

The case specifically held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
2. A person covered by the Social Security Act has not such a right in old-age benefit payments as would make every defeasance of &quot;accrued&quot; interests violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Pp. 608–611. (a) The noncontractual interest of an employee covered by the Act cannot be soundly analogized to that of the holder of an annuity, whose right to benefits are based on his contractual premium payments. Pp. 608–610. (b) To engraft upon the Social Security System a concept of &quot;accrued property rights&quot; would deprive it of the flexibility and [363 U.S. 603, 604] boldness in adjustment to ever-changing conditions which it demands and which Congress probably had in mind when it expressly reserved the right to alter, amend or repeal any provision of the Act. Pp. 610–611. 3. Section 202 (n) of the Act cannot be condemned as so lacking in rational justification as to offend due process. Pp. 611–612. 4. Termination of appellee's benefits under 202 (n) does not amount to punishing him without a trial, in violation of Art. III, 2, cl. 3, of the Constitution or the Sixth Amendment; nor is 202 (n) a [[bill of attainder]] or ex post facto law, since its purpose is not punitive. Pp. 612–621.[65]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Supreme Court was also responsible for major changes in Social Security. Many of these cases were pivotal in changing the assumptions about differences in wage earning among men and women in the Social Security system.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice. ''In Pursuit of Equity'', 2001. p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Goldberg v. Kelly]] (1970): The Supreme Court ruled that the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] required there to be an evidentiary hearing before a recipient can be deprived of government benefits.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot; /&gt;
* [[Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld]] (1975):  Stephen Wiesenfeld was a widower who claimed that he was entitled to his deceased wife’s benefit, before this case a widow and their children were eligible for her husband's Social Security benefits, however if a wife died only her children and not the widower could receive benefits. Wiesenfeld believed that this violated his right to equal protection under the due process clause of the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]. The court upheld his claims, stating that automatically granting widows the benefits and denying them to widowers violated [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice.

From the late 1860s until the 1970s, several American cities had '''ugly laws''' that deemed it illegal for persons who were &quot;unsightly&quot; or &quot;unseemly&quot;  to appear in public. Some of these laws were called '''unsightly beggar ordinances'''.

== History ==
Ugly laws arose in the late nineteenth century in U.S. cities. During this period, urban spaces underwent a sharp influx of new residents, as both resident and immigrant populations were drawn to cities; their new populations were often impoverished, as, in the 1870s, the country underwent an economic downturn; and new residents were often veterans of the Civil War who were visibly disabled. This meant large numbers of people who were strangers to each other now occupied closer quarters than they had in small towns, where such local institutions as schools, families, and churches helped moderate social relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women in Public: Between Banners and Ballots 1825-1880.|last = Ryan|first = Mary|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 1992|isbn = |location = Baltimore|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Whose City? Public and Private Spaces in Nineteenth-Century Chicago|last = Duis|first = Perry|date = Spring 1983|journal = Chicago History: The Manual of the Chicago Historical Society|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the pressures of condensed urban populations, local city councils attempted to regulate conduct on the streets using their law-making capacities. Ugly laws identified groups of people as disturbing the flow of public life and banned them from public spaces. Such people, deemed &quot;unsightly&quot; or &quot;unseemly,&quot; were usually impoverished and often beggars. Thus ugly laws were methods by which lawmakers attempted to remove the poor from sight.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Examples==
The first ordinance thus far discovered by historians is one passed in 1867 in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Quoted in Schweik, Susan. ''The Ugly Laws: Disability in Public'' ([[NYU Press|New York: NYU Press]] 2009), pp. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ordinances were passed in the 1880s in Western and particularly Midwestern cities, which experienced intense crowding during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Ugly laws extended eastward: [[Pennsylvania]] passed a state version of the law in the early 1890s. [[New York (state)|New York]] made an unsuccessful attempt at a city ordinance in 1895.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;Brown, Patricia Leigh. &quot;Viewing Ahab and Barbie Through the Lens of Disability.&quot; ''[[New York Times]]'' (August 20, 2000) as quoted by http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-29736932_ITM&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago ordinance of 1881 read as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas the streets and sidewalks of the City of Chicago contain numerous beggars, [[mendicant]]s, organ-grinders and other unsightly and unseemly objects, which are a reproach to the City, disagreeable to people upon the streets, an offense to business houses along the streets and often dangerous, Therefore be it ordered, That the mayor at once take steps to remove from the streets all beggars, mendicants, and all those who by way of making Exhibition of themselves and their infirmaries seek to obtain money from people on and along the streets.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In most cities, punishments for violating an ugly law ranged from [[incarceration]] to [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s of up to $50 for each offense.

==Repeal==
Many ugly laws were not repealed until the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;burgdorf&quot;&gt;Marcia Pearce Burgdorf and Robert Burgdorf, Jr., “A History of Unequal Treatment: The Qualifications of Handicapped Persons as a Suspect Class Under the Equal Protection Clause,” Santa Clara Lawyer 15:4 (1975) 855-910.&lt;/ref&gt; Omaha repealed its ugly law in 1967. Columbus withdrew its in 1972. Chicago, Illinois was the last to repeal its ugly law in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncld-youth.info/index.php?id=61 |title=Disability History: Timeline |publisher=Ncld-youth.info |date=1939-07-04 |accessdate=2015-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Americans with Disabilities Act==
The recantation of ugly laws preceded the passing of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] of 1990 where certain rights were granted to [[people with disabilities]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Individuals with disabilities are a [[Discrete and insular minorities|discrete and insular minority]] who have been faced with restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, and relegated to a position of political powerlessness in our society, based on characteristics that are beyond the control of such individuals and resulting from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of the individual ability of such individuals to participate in, and contribute to, society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fredman|first1=Sandra|title=Discrimination Law|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199584427|page=96|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="157321">[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary aerial crop.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Eastern State Penitentiary, constructed in the 1820s during the first major wave of penitentiary building in the United States.]]

Imprisonment as a form of criminal punishment only became widespread in the United States just before the [[American Revolution]], though penal incarceration efforts had been ongoing in [[England]] since as early as the 1500s, and [[prison]]s in the form of [[dungeon]]s and various detention facilities had existed since long before then. Prison building efforts in the United States came in three major waves. The first began during the [[Jacksonian Era]] and led to widespread use of imprisonment and [[Penal labor in the United States|rehabilitative labor]] as the primary penalty for most crimes in nearly all states by the time of the [[American Civil War]]. The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the [[Progressive Era]], bringing a number of new mechanisms—such as [[parole]], [[probation]], and [[indefinite imprisonment|indeterminate sentencing]]—into the mainstream of American penal practice. Finally, since the early 1970s, the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level. Since 1973, the [[United States incarceration rate|number of incarcerated persons]] in the United States has increased five-fold, and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; These periods of prison construction and reform produced major changes in the structure of prison systems and their missions, the responsibilities of federal and state agencies for administering and supervising them, as well as the legal and political status of prisoners themselves.

==Intellectual origins of United States prisons==
Incarceration as a form of criminal punishment is &quot;a comparatively recent episode in Anglo-American jurisprudence,&quot; according to historian Adam J. Hirsch.&lt;ref name=autogenerated49&gt;Hirsch, xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the nineteenth century, sentences of penal confinement were rare in the criminal courts of British North America.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, xi&lt;/ref&gt; But penal incarceration had been utilized in England as early as the reign of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudors]], if not before.&lt;ref name=autogenerated80&gt;Hirsch, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; When post-revolutionary prisons emerged in United States, they were, in Hirsch's words, not a &quot;fundamental departure&quot; from the former American colonies' intellectual past.&lt;ref name=autogenerated115&gt;Hirsch, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Early American prisons systems like [[Massachusetts|Massachusetts']] [[Castle Island (Massachusetts)|Castle Island Penitentiary]], built in 1780, essentially imitated the model of the 1500s English [[workhouse]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated115 /&gt;

===The English workhouse===
{{See also|Workhouse}}

[[File:Workroom at St James Workhouse.jpg|right|225px|thumb|&quot;The workroom at St James's workhouse&quot;, from ''The Microcosm of London'' (1808)]]

The English [[workhouse]], an intellectual forerunner of early United States penitentiaries, was first developed as a &quot;cure&quot; for the idleness of the poor. Over time English officials and reformers came to see the workhouse as a more general system for rehabilitating criminals of all kinds.

Common wisdom in the England of the 1500s attributed property crime to idleness. &quot;Idleness&quot; had been a status crime since [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] enacted the Statute of Laborers in the mid-fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated80 /&gt; By 1530, English subjects convicted of leading a &quot;Rogishe or Vagabonds Trade or Lyfe&quot; were subject to whipping and mutilation, and recidivists could face the death penalty.&lt;ref name=autogenerated80 /&gt;

In 1557, many in England perceived that vagrancy was on the rise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirsch, 14; McKelvey, 3&quot;&gt;Hirsch, 14; McKelvey, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the City of London reopened the [[Bridewell]] as a warehouse for vagrants arrested within the city limits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirsch, 14; McKelvey, 3&quot;/&gt; By order of any two of the Bridewell's governors, a person could be committed to the prison for a term of custody ranging from several weeks to several years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated135&gt;Hirsch, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades that followed, &quot;houses of correction&quot; or &quot;[[workhouses]]&quot; like the Bridewell became a fixture of towns across England—a change made permanent when Parliament began requiring every county in the realm to build a workhouse in 1576.&lt;ref name=autogenerated135 /&gt;

The workhouse was not just a custodial institution. At least some of its proponents hoped that the experience of incarceration would rehabilitate workhouse residents through hard labor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated135 /&gt; Supporters expressed the belief that forced abstinence from &quot;idleness&quot; would make vagrants into productive citizens.&lt;ref name=autogenerated135 /&gt; Other supporters argued that the threat of the workhouse would deter vagrancy, and that inmate labor could provide a means of support for the workhouse itself.&lt;ref name=autogenerated135 /&gt; Governance of these institutions was controlled by written regulations promulgated by local authorities, and local justices of the peace monitored compliance.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although &quot;vagrants&quot; were the first inhabitants of the workhouse—not felons or other criminals—expansion of its use to criminals was discussed.

During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, several programs experimented with sentencing various petty criminals to the workhouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated102&quot;/&gt; Many petty criminals were sentenced to the workhouse by way of the vagrancy laws even before these efforts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated102&gt;Hirsch, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; A commission appointed by [[King James I]] in 1622 to reprieve felons condemned to death with banishment to the American colonies was also given authority to sentence offenders &quot;to toyle in some such heavie and painful manuall workes and labors here at home and be kept in chains in the house of correction or other places,&quot; until the King or his ministers decided otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Within three years, a growing body of laws authorized incarceration in the workhouse for specifically enumerated petty crimes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated102 /&gt;

Throughout the 1700s, even as England's &quot;[[Bloody Code]]&quot; took shape, incarceration at hard labor was held out as an acceptable punishment for criminals of various kinds—''e.g.'', those who received a suspended death sentence via the [[benefit of clergy]] or a [[pardon]], those who were not transported to the colonies, or those convicted of petty [[larceny]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1779—at a time when the [[American Revolution]] had made [[penal transportation|convict transportation]] to North America impracticable—the [[English Parliament]] passed the [[Penitentiary Act]], mandating the construction of two London prisons with internal regulations modeled on the Dutch workhouse—''i.e.'', prisoners would labor more or less constantly during the day, with their diet, clothing, and communication strictly controlled.&lt;ref&gt;Meranze, 141; Hirsch, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Penitentiary Act promised to make penal incarceration the focal point of English criminal law,&lt;ref name=autogenerated19&gt;Meranze, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; a series of the penitentiaries it prescribed were never constructed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;Hirsch, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the ultimate failure of the Penitentiary Act, however, the legislation marked the culmination of a series of legislative efforts that &quot;disclose[] the . . . antiquity, continuity, and durability&quot; of rehabilitative incarceration ideology in Anglo-American criminal law, according to historian Adam J. Hirsch.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; The first United States penitentiaries involved elements of the early English workhouses—hard labor by day and strict supervision of inmates.

===English philanthropist penology===
[[File:John Howard by Mather Brown.jpg|thumb|right|200px|John Howard, English philanthropist penal reformer.]]

A second group that supported penal incarceration in England included clergymen and &quot;lay pietists&quot; of various religious denominations who made efforts during the 1700s to reduce the severity of the English criminal justice system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; Initially, reformers like [[John Howard]] focused on the harsh conditions of pre-trial detention in English jails.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; But many philanthropists did not limit their efforts to jail administration and inmate hygiene; they were also interested in the spiritual health of inmates and curbing the common practice of mixing all prisoners together at random.&lt;ref name=autogenerated64&gt;Hirsch, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Their ideas about inmate classification and solitary confinement match another undercurrent of penal innovation in the United States that persisted into the [[Progressive Era]].

Beginning with [[Samuel Denne]]'s ''Letter to Lord Ladbroke'' (1771) and [[Jonas Hanway|Jonas Hanway's]] ''Solitude in Imprisonment'' (1776), philanthropic literature on English penal reform began to concentrate on the post-conviction rehabilitation of criminals in the prison setting. Although they did not speak with a single voice, the philanthropist penologists tended to view crime as an outbreak of the criminal's estrangement from God.&lt;ref name=autogenerated64 /&gt; Hanway, for example, believed that the challenge of rehabilitating the criminal law lay in restoring his faith in, and fear of the [[Christianity|Christian God]], in order to &quot;qualify [him] for happiness in both worlds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Hirsch, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jonas Hanway by James Northcote.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Philanthropist penal reformer Jonas Hanway, author of ''Solitude in Imprisonment'' (1776), circa 1785.]]

Many eighteenth-century English philanthropists proposed [[solitary confinement]] as a way to rehabilitate inmates morally.&lt;ref name=autogenerated64 /&gt; Since at least 1740, philanthropic thinkers touted the use of penal solitude for two primary purposes: (1) to isolate prison inmates from the moral contagion of other prisoners, and (2) to jump-start their spiritual recovery.&lt;ref name=autogenerated64 /&gt; The philanthropists found solitude far superior to hard labor, which only reached the convict's worldly self, failing to get at the underlying spiritual causes of crime.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 19&lt;/ref&gt; In their conception of prison as a &quot;penitentiary,&quot; or place of repentance for sin, the English philanthropists departed from Continental models and gave birth to a largely novel idea—according to social historians Michael Meranze and Michael Ignatieff—which in turn found its way into penal practice in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Meranze, 141; Ignatieff, 93–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major political obstacle to implementing the philanthropists' solitary program in England was financial: Building individual cells for each prisoner cost more than the congregate housing arrangements typical of eighteenth-century English jails.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirsch, 20&quot;&gt;Hirsch, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; But by the 1790s, local solitary confinement facilities for convicted criminals appeared in [[Gloucestershire]] and several other English counties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirsch, 20&quot;/&gt;

The philanthropists' focus on isolation and moral contamination became the foundation for early penitentiaries in the United States. Philadelphians of the period eagerly followed the reports of philanthropist reformer [[John Howard]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt; And the archetypical penitentiaries that emerged in the 1820s United States—''e.g.'', [[Auburn Prison|Auburn]] and [[Eastern State Penitentiary|Eastern State]] penitentiaries—both implemented a solitary regime aimed at morally rehabilitating prisoners. The concept of inmate classification—or dividing prisoners according to their behavior, age, etc.—remains in use in United States prisons to this day.

===Rationalist penology===
[[File:Cesare Beccaria 1738-1794.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Cesare Beccaria]], Italian rationalist penal reformer and author of ''[[On Crimes and Punishments]]'' (1764).]]

A third group involved in English penal reform were the [[rationalism|&quot;rationalists&quot;]] or [[utilitarianism|&quot;utlitarians&quot;]]. According to historian Adam J. Hirsch, eighteenth-century rationalist criminology &quot;rejected scripture in favor of human logic and reason as the only valid guide to constructing social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteenth-century rational philosophers like [[Cesare Beccaria]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]] developed a &quot;novel theory of crime&quot;—specifically, that what made an action subject to criminal punishment was the harm it caused to other members of society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated126&gt;Hirsch, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; For the rationalists, sins that did not result in social harm were outside the purview of civil courts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated126 /&gt; With [[John Locke|John Locke's]] [[sensualism|&quot;sensational psychology&quot;]] as a guide, which maintained that environment alone defined human behavior, many rationalists sought the roots of a criminal's behavior in his or her past environment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated126 /&gt;

Rationalists differed as to what environmental factors gave rise to criminality. Some rationalists, including [[Cesare Beccaria]], blamed criminality on the ''uncertainty'' criminal punishment, whereas earlier criminologists had linked criminal deterrence to the ''severity'' of punishment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated126 /&gt; In essence, Beccaria believed that where arrest, conviction, and sentencing for crime were &quot;rapid and infallible,&quot; punishments for crime could remain moderate.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 21; McKelvey, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Beccaria did not take issue with the substance of contemporary penal codes—e.g., [[Flagellation|whipping]] and the [[pillory]]; rather, he took issue with their form and implementation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated126 /&gt;

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Jeremy Bentham]], English rationalist penal reformer and designer of the [[Panopticon]].]]

Other rationalists, like [[Jeremy Bentham]], believed that deterrence alone could not end criminality and looked instead to the [[social environment]] as the ultimate source of crime.&lt;ref name=autogenerated90&gt;Hirsch, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham's conception of criminality led him to concur with philanthropist reformers on the need for rehabilitation of offenders.&lt;ref name=autogenerated90 /&gt; But, unlike the philanthropists, Bentham and like-minded rationalists believed the true goal of rehabilitation was to show convicts the logical &quot;inexpedience&quot; of crime, not their estrangement from religion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated90 /&gt; For these rationalists, society was the source of and the solution to crime.

Ultimately, hard labor became the preferred rationalist therapy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated46&gt;Hirsch, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham eventually adopted this approach, and his well-known design for the [[Panopticon]] prison called for inmates to labor in solitary cells for the course of their imprisonment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated46 /&gt; Another rationalist, [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland|William Eden]], collaborated with [[John Howard]] and Justice [[William Blackstone]] in drafting the [[Penitentiary Act]] of 1779, which called for a penal regime of hard labor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated46 /&gt;

According to social and legal historian Adam J. Hirsch, the rationalists had only a secondary impact on United States penal practices.&lt;ref name=autogenerated46 /&gt; But their ideas—whether consciously adopted by United States prison reformers or not—resonate in various United States penal initiatives to the present day.&lt;ref name=autogenerated46 /&gt;

==Historical development of United States prison systems==
Although convicts played a significant role in British settlement of North America, according to legal historian Adam J. Hirsch &quot;[t]he wholesale incarceration of criminals is in truth a comparatively recent episode in the history of Anglo-American jurisprudence.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated49 /&gt; Imprisonment facilities were present from the earliest English settlement of North America, but the fundamental purpose of these facilities changed in the early years of United States legal history as a result of a geographically widespread &quot;penitentiary&quot; movement.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The form and function of prison systems in the United States has continued to change as a result of political and scientific developments, as well as notable reform movements during the [[Jacksonian Era]], [[Reconstruction Era]], [[Progressive Era]], and the 1970s. But the status of penal incarceration as the primary mechanism for criminal punishment has remained the same since its first emergence in the wake of the [[American Revolution]].

===Early settlement, convict transportation, and the prisoner trade===

[[File:RichardHakluyt-BristolCathedral-stainedglasswindow.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Richard Hakluyt]], promoter of large-scale English settlement in the [[Jamestown Colony]] by convicts, as depicted in stained glass in the west window of the south transept of Bristol Cathedral.]]

Prisoners and prisons appeared in North America simultaneous to the arrival of European settlers. Among the ninety or so men who sailed with the explorer known as [[Christopher Columbus]] were a young black man abducted from the [[Canary Islands]] and at least four convicts.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1570, Spanish soldiers in [[St. Augustine, Florida]], had built the first substantial prison in [[North America]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated18&gt;Christianson, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; As other European nations began to compete with [[Spain]] for land and wealth in the [[New World]], they too turned to convicts to fill out the crews on their ships.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;

According to social historian Marie Gottschalk, convicts were &quot;indispensable&quot; to English settlement efforts in what is now the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk, 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late sixteenth century, [[Richard Hakluyt]] called for the large-scale conscription of criminals to settle the New World for England.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt; But official action on Haklyut's proposal lagged until 1606, when the English crown escalated its [[colonization]] efforts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;

[[Sir John Popham|Sir John Popham's]] colonial venture in present-day [[Maine]] was stocked, a contemporary critic complained, &quot;out of all the gaols [jails] of England.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated124&gt;Christianson, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Virginia Company]], the corporate entity responsible for settling [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], authorized its colonists to seize [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] children wherever they could &quot;for conversion ... to the knowledge and worship of the true God and their redeemer, Christ Jesus.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated124 /&gt; The colonists themselves lived, in effect, as prisoners of the Company's governor and his agents.&lt;ref name=autogenerated124 /&gt; Men caught trying to escape were tortured to death; seamstresses who erred in their sewing were subject to whipping.&lt;ref name=autogenerated124 /&gt; One Richard Barnes, accused of uttering &quot;base and detracting words&quot; against the governor, was ordered to be &quot;disarmed and have his arms broken and his tongue bored through with an awl&quot; before being banished from the settlement entirely.&lt;ref name=autogenerated124 /&gt;

When control of the Virginia Company passed to Sir [[Edwin Sandys (died 1629)|Edwin Sandys]] in 1618, efforts to bring large numbers of settlers to the New World against their will gained traction alongside less coercive measures like [[indentured servant|indentured servitude]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated104&gt;Christianson, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Vagrancy statutes began to provide for [[transportation|penal transportation]] to the American colonies as an alternative to [[capital punishment]] in this period, during the reign of [[Queen Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated104 /&gt; At the same time, the legal definition of &quot;vagrancy&quot; was greatly expanded.&lt;ref name=autogenerated104 /&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth I Darnley Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Under [[Queen Elizabeth I]], English vagrancy laws began increasingly to provide for [[penal transportation]] as a substitute for capital sentences.]]

Soon, a royal commissions endorsed the notion that any felon—except those convicted of murder, witchcraft, burglary, or rape—could legally by transported to Virginia or the West Indies to work as a plantation servant.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Sandys also proposed sending maids to Jamestown as &quot;breeders,&quot; whose costs of passage could be paid for by the planters who took them on as &quot;wives.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated65&gt;Christianson, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Before long, over sixty such women had made the passage to Virginia, and more followed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated65 /&gt; [[King James I|King James I's]] royal administration also sent &quot;vagrant&quot; children to the New World as servants.&lt;ref name=autogenerated65 /&gt; a letter in the [[Virginia Company|Virginia Company's]] records suggests that as many as 1,500 children were sent to Virginia between 1619 and 1617.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Christianson, 12&lt;/ref&gt; By 1619, African prisoners were brought to Jamestown and sold as slaves as well, marking England's entry into the [[Atlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated136&gt;Christianson, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The infusion of kidnapped children, maids, convicts, and Africans to Virginia during the early part of the seventeenth century inaugurated a pattern that would continue for nearly two centuries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated136 /&gt; By 1650, the majority of British emigrants to colonial North America went as &quot;prisoners&quot; of one sort or another—whether as indentured servants, convict laborers, or slaves.&lt;ref name=autogenerated75&gt;Christianson, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prisoner trade became the &quot;moving force&quot; of English colonial policy after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]—i.e., from the summer of 1660 onward—according to &lt;ref name=autogenerated75 /&gt; By 1680, the Reverend [[Francis Godwin|Morgan Godwyn]] estimated that almost 10,000 persons were spirited away to the Americas annually by the English crown.&lt;ref name=autogenerated75 /&gt;

[[Parliament of England|Parliament]] accelerated the prisoner trade in the eighteenth century. Under England's [[Bloody Code]], a large portion of the realm's convicted criminal population faced the death penalty. But pardons were common. During the eighteenth century, the majority of those sentenced to die in English courts were pardoned—often in exchange for voluntary transport to the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1717, Parliament empowered the English courts to directly sentence offenders to transportation, and by 1769 transportation was the leading punishment for serious crime in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Over two-thirds of those sentenced during sessions of the [[Old Bailey]] in 1769 were transported.&lt;ref name=autogenerated40&gt;Christianson, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The list of &quot;serious crimes&quot; warranting transportation continued to expand throughout the eighteenth century, as it had during the seventeenth.&lt;ref name=autogenerated40 /&gt; Historian A. Roger Ekirch estimates that as many as one-quarter of all British emigrants to colonial America during the 1700s were convicts.&lt;ref&gt;Ekirch, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1720s, [[James Oglethorpe]] settled the colony of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] almost entirely with convict settlers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated75 /&gt;

The typical transported convict during the 1700s was brought to the North American colonies on board a &quot;prison ship.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated28&gt;Christianson, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival, the convict's keepers would bathe and clothe him or her (and, in extreme cases, provide a fresh wig) in preparation for a convict auction.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28 /&gt; Newspapers advertised the arrival of a convict cargo in advance, and buyers would come at an appointed hour to purchase convicts off the auction block.&lt;ref name=autogenerated28 /&gt;

[[File:Old Newgate.jpg|thumb|200px|The Old [[Newgate Prison]] in [[London]] was one of many detention centers that facilitated the convict trade between England and its American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries.]]

Prisons played an essential role in the convict trade. Some ancient prisons, like [[Fleet Prison|the Fleet]] and [[Newgate Prison|Newgate]], still remained in use during the high period of the American prisoner trade in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; But more typically an old house, [[medieval]] [[dungeon]] space, or private structure would act as a holding pen for those bound for American [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]s or the [[Royal Navy]] (under [[impressment]]).&lt;ref name=autogenerated55&gt;Christianson, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Operating clandestine prisons in major port cities for detainees whose transportation to the New World was not strictly legal, became a lucrative trade on both sides of the Atlantic in this period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated55 /&gt; Unlike contemporary prisons, those associated with the convict trade served a custodial, not a punitive function.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many colonists in British North America resented [[penal transportation|convict transportation]]. As early as 1683, [[Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania's]] colonial [[legislature]] attempted to bar [[felony|felons]] from being introduced within its borders.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Franklin]] called convict transportation &quot;an insult and contempt, the cruellest, that ever one people offered to another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Christianson, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin suggested that the colonies send some of North America's [[rattlesnake]]s to England, to be set loose in its finest parks, in revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; But transportation of convicts to England's North American colonies continued until the [[American Revolution]], and many officials in England saw it as a humane necessity in light of the harshness of the penal code and contemporary conditions in English jails.&lt;ref name=autogenerated17&gt;Christianson, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Samuel Johnson]], upon hearing that British authorities might bow to continuing agitation in the American colonies against transportation, reportedly told [[James Boswell]]: &quot;Why they are a race of convicts, and ought to be thankful for anything we allow them short of hanging!&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated17 /&gt;

When the [[American Revolution]] ended the prisoner trade to North America, the abrupt halt threw Britain's penal system into disarray, as prisons and jails quickly filled with the many convicts who previously would have moved on to the colonies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated26&gt;Christianson, 75; ''see also'' Meranze, 141; Hirsch, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions steadily worsened.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated26&quot;/&gt; It was during this crisis period in the English criminal justice system that penal reformer [[John Howard]] began his work.&lt;ref name=autogenerated26 /&gt; Howard's comprehensive study of British penal practice, ''The State of the Prisons in England and Wales'', was first published in 1777—one year after the start of the [[American Revolution|Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Meranze, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial criminal punishments, jails, and workhouses===
[[File:Oldest wooden jail in America.jpg|thumb|The [[Old Jail (Barnstable, Massachusetts)|&quot;Old Gaol [Jail]&quot;]] in [[Barnstable, Massachusetts]], built in 1690 and operated until 1820, is today the oldest wooden jail in the United States of America.]]

The jail was built in 1690 by order of Plimouth and Massachusetts Bay Colony Courts. Used as a jail from 1690–1820; at one time moved and attached to the Constable's home. The 'Old Gaol' was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

Although jails were an early fixture of colonial North American communities, they generally did not serve as places of incarceration as a form of criminal punishment. Instead, the main role of the colonial American jail was as a non-punitive detention facility for pre-trial and pre-sentence criminal defendants, as well as [[debtors' prison|imprisoned debtors]]. The most common penal sanctions of the day were [[fine (penalty)|fines]], [[Flagellation|whipping]], and community-oriented punishments like [[the stocks]].

Jails were among the earliest public structures built in colonial British North America.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1629 colonial charter of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], for example, granted the [[shareholder]]s behind the venture the right to establish laws for their settlement &quot;not contrarie to the lawes of our realm in England&quot; and to administer &quot;lawfull correction&quot; to violators,&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and Massachusetts established a house of correction for punishing criminals by 1635.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Hirsch, 6; Christianson, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial [[Pennsylvania]] built two houses of correction starting in 1682, and [[Connecticut]] established one in 1727. By the eighteenth century, every county in the North American colonies had a jail.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 6–7; Christianson, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prisoners whipped.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A [[whipping post]] or [[pillory]], with [[stocks]] atop it, at the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] Jail, Delaware, in 1897.]]

Colonial American jails were not the &quot;ordinary mechanism of correction&quot; for criminal offenders, according to social historian [[David Rothman]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal incarceration as a penal sanction was &quot;plainly a second choice,&quot; either a supplement to or a substitute for traditional criminal punishments of the day, in the words of historian Adam J. Hirsch.&lt;ref name=autogenerated38&gt;Hirsch, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteenth-century criminal codes provided for a far wider range of criminal punishments than contemporary state and federal criminal laws in the United States. [[fine (penalty)|Fines]], [[flagellation|whippings]], the [[stocks]], the [[pillory]], the public cage, [[banishment]], [[capital punishment]] at the [[gallows]], penal servitude in private homes—all of these punishments came before imprisonment in British colonial America.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 48; Hirsch, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common sentence of the colonial era was a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] or a [[Flagellation|whipping]], but [[the stocks]] were another common punishment—so much so that most colonies, like Virginia in 1662, hastened to build these before either the courthouse or the jail.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Rothman, ''Discovery'', 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[theocracy|theocratic]] communities of [[Puritan]] [[Massachusetts]] imposed faith-based punishments like the [[admonition]]—a formal censure, apology, and pronouncement of criminal sentence (generally reduced or suspended), performed in front of the church-going community.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Sentences to the colonial American [[workhouse]]—when they were actually imposed on defendants—rarely exceeded three months, and sometimes spanned just a single day.&lt;ref name=autogenerated38 /&gt;

Colonial jails served a variety of public functions other than penal imprisonment. [[Debtors' prison|Civil imprisonment for debt]] was one of these,&lt;ref name=autogenerated68&gt;Hirsch, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; but colonial jails also served as warehouses for [[prisoner-of-war|prisoners-of-war]] and [[political imprisonment|political prisoners]] (especially during the [[American Revolution]]).&lt;ref name=autogenerated68 /&gt; They were also an integral part of the [[penal transportation|transportation]] and [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] systems—not only as warehouses for convicts and slaves being put up for auction, but also as a means of disciplining both kinds of servants.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 59, 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1670 virginia tobacco slaves.jpg|thumb|250px|Depiction of slaves—another labor force brought to England's American colonies in captivity—processing tobacco in 17th-century Virginia.]]

The colonial jail's primary [[criminal law]] function was as a pre-trial and pre-sentence detention facility.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 7; Rothman, ''Discovery'', 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, only the poorest or most despised defendants found their way into the jails of colonial North America, since colonial judges rarely denied requests for [[bail]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The only penal function of significance that colonial jails served was for contempt—but this was a coercive technique designed to protect the power of the courts, not a penal sanction in its own right.&lt;ref name=autogenerated38 /&gt;

The colonial jail differed from today's United States prisons not only in its purpose, but in its structure. Many were no more than a cage or closet.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial jailers ran their institutions on a &quot;familial&quot; model and resided in an apartment attached to the jail, sometimes with a family of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 61; Hirsch, 9; Rothman, ''Discovery'', 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial jail's design resembled an ordinary domestic residence,&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 53.&lt;/ref&gt; and inmates essentially rented their bed and paid the jailer for necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 56; Christianson, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the close of the [[American Revolution]], few statutes or regulations defined the colonial jailers' duty of care or other responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Upkeep was often haphazard, and escapes quite common.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 9; Christianson, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Few official efforts were made to maintain inmates' health or see to their other basic needs.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 9; Christianson, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Revolutionary Penal Reform and the Beginnings of United States Prison Systems===
[[File:HillsMap1796.jpg|thumb|A map of Philadelphia in 1796, at a time when a century of population growth and social change was beginning to transform crime and punishment in the city and elsewhere in the early United States.]]

The first major prison reform movement in the United States came after the [[American Revolution]], at the start of the nineteenth century. According to historians Adam J. Hirsch and [[David Rothman]], the reform of this period was shaped less by intellectual movements in England than by a general clamor for action in a time of population growth and increasing social mobility, which prompted a critical reappraisal and revision of penal corrective techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 57; Hirsch, 32, 114.&lt;/ref&gt; To address these changes, post-colonial legislators and reformers began to stress the need for a system of hard labor to replace ineffectual corporal and traditional punishments. Ultimately, these early efforts yielded the United States' first penitentiary systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

The onset of the eighteenth century brought major demographic and social change to colonial and, eventually post-colonial American life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirsch, 39&quot;&gt;Hirsch, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The century was marked by rapid population growth throughout the colonies—a result of lower [[mortality rate]]s and increasing (though small at first) rates of [[immigration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirsch, 39&quot;/&gt; In the aftermath of the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]], this trend persisted. Between 1790 and 1830, the population of the newly independent North American states greatly increased, and the number and density of urban centers did as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothman, Discovery, 58&quot;&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Massachusetts almost doubled in this period, while it tripled in Pennsylvania and increased five-fold in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothman, Discovery, 58&quot;/&gt; In 1790, no American city had more than fifty thousand residents; however, by 1830 nearly 500,000 people lived in cities larger than that.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothman, Discovery, 58&quot;/&gt;

The population of the former British colonies also became increasingly mobile during the eighteenth century, especially after the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 35, 55; Rothman, ''Discovery'', 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Movement to urban centers, in and out of emerging territories, and up and down a more fluid social ladder throughout the century made it difficult for the localism and hierarchy that had structured American life in the seventeenth century to retain their former significance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothman, Discovery, 58&quot;/&gt; The Revolution only accelerated patterns of dislocation and transience, leaving displaced families and former soldiers struggling to adapt to the strictures of a stunted post-war economy.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of cities created a kind of community very different from the pre-revolutionary model. The crowded streets of emerging urban centers like Philadelphia seemed to contemporary observers to dangerously blur class, sex, and racial boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Meranze, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Bradford (1755-1795).jpg|thumb|left|[[William Bradford (Rhode Island)|William Bradford]], like other commentators of the post-revolutionary period, believed that the harsh punishments of English criminal law had perpetuated crime in the North American colonies.]]

Demographic change in the eighteenth century coincided with shifts in the configuration of crime.&lt;ref name=autogenerated130&gt;Hirsch, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1700, literary evidence from a variety of sources—''e.g.'', ministers, newspapers, and judges—suggest that property crime rates rose (or, at least, were perceived to).&lt;ref name=autogenerated130 /&gt; Conviction rates appear to have risen during the last half of the eighteenth century, rapidly so in the 1770s and afterward and especially in urban areas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated130 /&gt; Contemporary accounts also suggest widespread transiency among former criminals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated130 /&gt;

Communities began to think about their town as something less than the sum of all its inhabitants during this period, and the notion of a distinct criminal class began to materialize.&lt;ref name=autogenerated130 /&gt; In the Philadelphia of the 1780s, for example, city authorities worried about the proliferation of taverns on the outskirts of the city, &quot;sites of an alternative, interracial, lower-class culture&quot; that was, in the words of one observer, &quot;the very root of vice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Meranze, 99–100 (contemporary quotation at 100).&lt;/ref&gt; In Boston, a higher urban crime rate led to the creation of a specialized, urban court in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Hindus, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficacy of traditional, community-based punishments waned during the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Hirsch, ch. 3, 4; Rothman, ''Discovery'', ch. 3; Meranze, ch. 3; Hindus, ch. 8, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Penal servitude, a mainstay of British and colonial American criminal justice, became nearly extinct during the seventeenth century, at the same time that Northern states, beginning with [[Vermont]] in 1777, began to abolish slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 37&lt;/ref&gt; Fines and bonds for good behavior—one of the most common criminal sentences of the colonial era—were nearly impossible to enforce among the transient poor.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; As the former American colonists expanded their political loyalty beyond the parochial to their new state governments, promoting a broader sense of the public welfare, banishment (or &quot;[[warning out]]&quot;) also seemed inappropriate, since it merely passed criminals onto a neighboring community.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 58; Meranze, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Public shaming punishments like the pillory had always been inherently unstable methods of enforcing the public order, since they depended in large part on the participation of the accused and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 50; Meranze, 20, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; As the eighteenth century matured, and a social distance between the criminal and the community became more manifest, mutual antipathy (rather than community compassion and offender penitence) became more common at public executions and other punishments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirsch, 39&quot;/&gt; In urban centers like Philadelphia, growing class and racial tensions—especially in the wake of the Revolution—led crowds to actively sympathize with the accused at executions and other public punishments.&lt;ref&gt;Meranze, 36–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial governments began making efforts to reform their penal architecture and excise many traditional punishments even before the Revolution. Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut all inaugurated efforts to reconstitute their penal systems in the years leading up to the war to make incarceration at hard labor the sole punishment for most crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[American Revolution|war]] interrupted these efforts, they were renewed afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;climate change&quot; in post-Revolutionary politics, in the words of historian Adam J. Hirsch, made colonial legislatures open to legal change of all sorts after the Revolution, as they retooled their constitutions and criminal codes to reflect their separation from England.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 47; Rothman, ''Discovery'', 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglophobic politics of the day bolstered efforts to do away with punishments inherited from English legal practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:State prison 1840.jpg|thumb|right|275px|An artist's 1840 depiction of Massachusetts' [[Charlestown State Prison]], opened in 1805 to accommodate the state's increasing prison population due to post-revolutionary penal reforms.]]

Reformers in the United States also began to discuss the effect of criminal punishment itself on criminality in the post-revolutionary period, and at least some concluded that the barbarism of colonial-era punishments, inherited from English penal practice, did more harm than good. &quot;The mild voice of reason and humanity,&quot; wrote New York penal reformer [[Thomas Eddy]] in 1801, &quot;reached not the thrones of princes or the halls of legislators.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated129&gt;Qtd. in Rothman, ''Discovery'', 58&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The mother country had stifled the colonists' benevolent instincts,&quot; according to Eddy, &quot;compelling them to emulate the crude customs of the old world. The result was the predominance of archaic and punitive laws that only served to perpetuate crime.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated129 /&gt; Attorney [[William Bradford (Rhode Island)|William Bradford]] made an argument similar to Eddy's in a 1793 treatise.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 58&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second decade of the nineteenth century every state except [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]] had amended its criminal code to provide for incarceration (primarily at hard labor) as the primary punishment for all but the most serious offenses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated106&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Provincial laws in Massachusetts began to prescribe short terms in the [[workhouse]] for deterrence throughout the eighteenth century and, by mid-century, the first statutes mandating long-term hard labor in the workhouse as a penal sanction appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New York (state)|New York]], a 1785 bill, restricted in effect to [[New York City]], authorized municipal officials to substitute up to six months' hard labor in the [[workhouse]] in all cases where prior law had mandated [[corporal punishment]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated53&gt;Hirsch, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1796, an additional bill expanded this program to the entire state of New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated53&quot;/&gt; [[Pennsylvania]] established a hard labor law in 1786.&lt;ref name=autogenerated53 /&gt; Hard-labor programs expanded to [[New Jersey]] in 1797, to [[Virginia]] in 1796, to [[Kentucky]] in 1798, and to [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Maryland]] in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 61; Hirsch, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

This move toward imprisonment did not translate to an immediate break from traditional forms of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 57, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Many new criminal provisions merely expanded the discretion of judges to choose from among various punishments, including imprisonment. The 1785 amendments to Massachusetts' arson statute, for instance, expanded the available punishments for setting fire to a non-dwelling from whipping to hard labor, imprisonment in jail, the pillory, whipping, fining, or any or all of those punishments in combination.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Massachusetts judges wielded this new-found discretion in various ways for twenty years, before fines, incarceration, or the death penalty became the sole available sanctions under the state's penal code.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Other states—''e.g.'', [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Connecticut]]—also lagged in their shift toward incarceration.&lt;ref name=autogenerated97&gt;Hirsch, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prison construction kept pace with post-revolutionary legal change. All states that revised their criminal codes to provide for incarceration also constructed new state prisons.&lt;ref name=autogenerated106 /&gt; But the focus of penal reformers in the post-revolutionary years remained largely external to the institutions they built, according to [[David Rothman]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated82&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 62.&lt;/ref&gt; For reformers of the day, Rothman claims, the fact of imprisonment—not the institution's internal routine and its effect on the offender—was of primary concern.&lt;ref name=autogenerated82 /&gt; Incarceration seemed more humane than traditional punishments like hanging and whipping, and it theoretically matched punishment more specifically to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, Discovery, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; But it would take another period of reform, in the [[Jacksonian Era]], for state prison initiatives to take the shape of actual justice institutions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated82 /&gt;

===Jacksonian and Antebellum era===
[[File:Philadelphia's Eastern State Penitentiary, main gate.jpg|thumb|287px|Present-day exterior shot of the gate at [[Eastern State Penitentiary]], birthplace of the [[Separate system|&quot;Pennsylvania (or Separate) System&quot;]] of prison governance.]]

By 1800, eleven of the then-sixteen United States—''i.e.'', [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Kentucky]], [[Vermont]], [[Maryland]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Virginia]]—had in place some form of penal incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 11–12; Christianson, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; But the primary focus of contemporary criminology remained on the legal system, according to historian [[David Rothman]], not the institutions in which convicts served their sentences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated82 /&gt; This changed during the Jacksonian Era, as contemporary notions of criminality continued to shift.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 62–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1820s, a new institution, the [[Prison|&quot;penitentiary&quot;]], gradually became the focal point of criminal justice in the United States.&lt;ref name=autogenerated58&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 79.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, other novel institutions—the [[insane asylum|asylum]] and the [[almshouse]]—redefined care for the [[mentally ill]] and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', ch. 6, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; For its proponents, the penitentiary was an ambitious program whose external appearance, internal arrangements, and daily routine would counteract the disorder and immorality thought to be breeding crime in American society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated58 /&gt; Although its adoption was haphazard at first, and marked by political strife—especially in the South—the penitentiary became an established institution in the United States by the end of the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 68; Meranze, 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

====New origins of deviancy and an institutional response====
[[File:Francis Wayland daguerreotype.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Francis Wayland]], a Baptist reformer of the antebellum period, advocated for the [[Auburn system|&quot;Auburn (or Congregate) System&quot;]].]]

Jacksonian-Era reformers and prison officials began seeking the origins of crime in the personal histories of criminals and traced the roots of crime to society itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 65&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of historian [[David Rothman]], &quot;They were certain that children lacking discipline quickly fell victim to the influence of vice at loose in the community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 66&lt;/ref&gt; Jacksonian reformers specifically tied rapid population growth and social mobility to the disorder and immorality of contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 69; Lewis, 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat society's decay and the risks presented by it, Jacksonian penologists designed an institutional setting to remove &quot;deviants&quot; from the corruption of their families and communities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated88&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 71&lt;/ref&gt; In this corruption-free environment, the deviant could learn the vital moral lessons he or she had previously ignored while sheltered from the temptations of vice.&lt;ref name=autogenerated88 /&gt; This solution ultimately took the shape of the penitentiary.

In the 1820s, New York and Pennsylvania began new prison initiatives that inspired similar efforts in a number of other states.&lt;ref name=autogenerated58 /&gt; Post-revolutionary carceral regimes had conformed to the English workhouse tradition; inmates labored together by day and shared congregate quarters at night.&lt;ref name=autogenerated97 /&gt;

[[File:Dix-Dorothea-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Antebellum reformer [[Dorothea Dix]] supported the [[Separate system|&quot;Pennsylvania (or Separate) System&quot;]].]]

Beginning in 1790, Pennsylvania became the first of the United States to institute solitary confinement for incarcerated convicts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated97 /&gt; After 1790, those sentenced to hard labor in Pennsylvania were moved indoors to an inner block of solitary cells in Philadelphia's [[Walnut Street Jail]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated97 /&gt; New York began implementing solitary living quarters at New York City's [[Greenwich Village#Newgate Prison|Newgate Prison]] in 1796.&lt;ref name=autogenerated97 /&gt;

From the efforts at the [[Walnut Street Jail]] and [[Greenwich Village#Newgate Prison|Newgate Prison]], two competing systems of imprisonment emerged in the United States by the 1820s. The [[Auburn System|&quot;Auburn&quot; (or &quot;Congregate System&quot;)]] emerged from New York's prison of the same name between 1819 and 1823.&lt;ref name=autogenerated51&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 79; Hirsch, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; And the [[separate system|&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; (or &quot;Separate System&quot;)]] emerged in that state between 1826 and 1829.&lt;ref name=autogenerated51 /&gt; The only material difference between the two systems was whether inmates would ever leave their solitary cells—under the [[separate system|Pennsylvania System]], inmates almost never did, but under the [[Auburn System]] most inmates labored in congregate workshops by day and slept alone.&lt;ref name=autogenerated51 /&gt;

To advocates of both systems, the promise of institutionalization depended upon isolating the prisoner from the moral contamination of society and establishing discipline in him (or, in rarer cases, her).&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; But the debate as to which system was superior continued into the mid-nineteenth century, pitting some of the period's most prominent reformers against one another.&lt;ref name=autogenerated100&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 81.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Gridley Howe]] promoted the Pennsylvania System in opposition to [[Matthew Carey]], an Auburn proponent; [[Dorothea Dix]] took up the Pennsylvania System against Louis Dwight; and Francis Lieber supported Pennsylvania against [[Francis Wayland]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated100 /&gt; The Auburn system eventually prevailed, however, due largely to its lesser cost.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 66; Lewis, 70, .&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Pennsylvania system====
{{See also|Separate system}}
[[File:ESP-cell.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Present-day photograph of a typical cell at the [[Eastern State Penitentiary]], where the [[Separate system|&quot;Pennsylvania (or Separate) System&quot;]] was first practiced, in restored condition.]]

The Pennsylvania system, first implemented in the early 1830s at that state's [[Eastern State Penitentiary]] outskirts of [[Philadelphia]] and [[West Park, Pittsburgh#Western Penitentiary|Western State Penitentiary]] at [[Pittsburgh]], was designed to maintain the complete separation of inmates at all times.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 132; McKelvey, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1904, prisoners entered the institution with a black hood over their head, so they would never know who their fellow convicts were, before being led to the cell where they would serve the remainder of their sentence in near-constant solitude.&lt;ref name=autogenerated108&gt;Christianson, 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cherry Hill complex entailed a massive expenditure of state funds; its walls alone cost $200,000,&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 132.&lt;/ref&gt; and its final price tag reached $750,000, one of the largest state expenditures of its day.&lt;ref&gt;McKelvey, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like its competitor Auburn system, Eastern State's regimen was premised on the inmate's potential for individual rehabilitation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated92&gt;Christianson, 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Solitude, not labor, was its hallmark; labor was reserved only for those inmates who affirmatively earned the privilege.&lt;ref name=autogenerated92 /&gt; All contact with the outside world more or less ceased for Eastern State prisoners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated108 /&gt; Proponents boasted that a Pennsylvania inmate was &quot;perfectly secluded from the world ... hopelessly separated from ... family, and from all communication with and knowledge of them for the whole term of imprisonment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Rothman, ''Discovery'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samuel Gridley Howe.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Samuel Gridley Howe]], antebellum American reformer and advocate for the [[Separate system|&quot;Pennsylvania (or Separate) System&quot;]] of prison governance.]]

Through isolation and silence—complete separation from the moral contaminants of the outside worlds—Pennsylvania supporters surmised that inmates would begin a reformation.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 85.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Each individual,&quot; a representative tract reads, &quot;will necessarily be made the instrument of his own punishment; his conscience will be the avenger of society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Rothman, ''Discovery'', 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents insisted that the Pennsylvania system would involve only mild disciplinary measures, reasoning that isolated men would have neither the resources nor the occasion to violate rules or to escape.&lt;ref name=autogenerated54&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 86.&lt;/ref&gt; But from the outset Eastern State's keepers used corporal punishments to enforce order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christianson, 136&quot;&gt;Christianson, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials used the &quot;iron gag,&quot; a bridle-like metal bit placed in the inmate's mouth and chained around his neck and head; the &quot;shower bath,&quot; repeated dumping of cold water onto a restrained convict; or the &quot;mad chair,&quot; into which inmates were strapped in such a way so as to prevent their bodies from resting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christianson, 136&quot;/&gt;

Ultimately, only three prisons ever enacted the costly Pennsylvania program.&lt;ref&gt;McKelvey, 12; Hirsch, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; But nearly all penal reformers of the antebellum period believed in Pennsylvania's use of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated108 /&gt; The system remained largely intact at Eastern State Penitentiary into the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated108 /&gt;

====New York, the Auburn system, and the future of the penitentiary====
{{See also|Auburn system}}
[[File:Elam Lynds.png|thumb|left|180px|[[Elam Lynds]], the first warden of the [[Auburn Correctional Facility|Auburn Penitentiary]], is credited with creating the [[Auburn system|&quot;Auburn (or Congregate) System.&quot;]]]]

The [[Auburn system|Auburn or &quot;Congregate&quot; System]] became the archetypical model penitentiary in the 1830s and 1840s, as its use expanded from New York's [[Auburn Correctional Facility|Auburn Penitentiary]] into the Northeast, [[Midwestern United States|the Midwest]], and [[Southern United States|the South]]. The Auburn system's combination of congregate labor in prison workshops and solitary confinement by night became a near-universal ideal in United States prison systems, if not an actual reality.

Under the Auburn system, prisoners slept alone at night and labored together in a congregate workshop during the day for the entirety of their fixed criminal sentence as set by a judge.&lt;ref name=autogenerated59&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners at Auburn were not to converse at any time, or even to exchange glances.&lt;ref name=autogenerated59 /&gt; Guards patrolled secret passageways behind the walls of the prison's workshops in moccasins, so inmates could never be sure whether or not they were under surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

One official described Auburn's discipline as &quot;tak[ing] measures for convincing the felon that he is no longer his own master; no longer in a condition to practice deceptions in idleness; that he must learn and practice diligently some useful trade, whereby, when he is let out of the prison to obtain an honest living.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Christianson, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates were permitted no intelligence of events on the outside. In the words of an early warden, Auburn inmates were &quot;to be literally buried from the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Rothman, ''Discovery'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The institution's regime remained largely intact until after the Civil War.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

[[File:State Prison, at Sing Sing, New York.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An 1855 [[wood engraving|engraving]] of New York's [[Sing Sing|Sing Sing Penitentiary]], which also followed the [[Auburn system|&quot;Auburn (or Congregate) System.&quot;]]]]

Auburn was the second state prison built in [[New York (state)|New York State]]. The first, [[Greenwich Village#Newgate Prison|Newgate]], located in present-day [[Greenwich Village]] in [[New York City]], contained no solitary cells beyond a few set aside for &quot;worst offenders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;W. David Lewis, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Its first keeper, [[Quaker]] [[Thomas Eddy]], believed rehabilitation of the criminal was the primary end of punishment (though Eddy also believed that his charges were &quot;wicked and depraved, capable of every atrocity, and ever plotting some means of violence and escape.&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;W. David Lewis, 31–32 (quotation at 31).&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy was not inclined to rely on prisoners' fear of his severity; his &quot;chief disciplinary weapon&quot; was solitary confinement on limited rations, he forbade his guards from striking inmates, and permitted &quot;well-behaved&quot; inmates to have a supervised visit with family once every three months.&lt;ref name=autogenerated118&gt;W. David Lewis, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy made largely unsuccessful efforts to establish profitable prison labor programs, which he had hoped would cover incarceration costs and provide seed money for inmates' re-entry into society in the form of the &quot;overstint&quot;—i.e., a small portion of the profits of an inmate's labor while incarcerated, payable at his or her release.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Discipline nevertheless remained hard to enforce, and major riots occurred in 1799 and 1800—the latter only subdued via military intervention.&lt;ref&gt;W. David Lewis, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions continued to worsen in the wake of the riots, especially during a crime wave that followed the War of 1812.&lt;ref&gt;W. David Lewis, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sing Sing (prison) - cell.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Present-day photograph of a cell in the older facility at [[Sing Sing|Sing Sing Penitentiary]].]]

New York legislators set aside funds for construction of the Auburn prison to address the disappointments of [[Greenwich Village#Newgate Prison|Newgate]] and alleviate its persistent overcrowding.&lt;ref&gt;W. David Lewis, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost from the outset, Auburn officials, with the consent of the legislature, eschewed the &quot;humane&quot; style envisioned by [[Thomas Eddy]] for Newgate.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 112; W. David Lewis, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Floggings of up to thirty-nine lashes in duration as punishment for disciplinary infractions were permitted under an 1819 state law, which also authorized the use of the stocks and the irons.&lt;ref&gt;W. David Lewis, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of providing convicts with some of the proceeds of their labor at the time of release, the &quot;overstint,&quot; was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The severity of the new regime likely caused another series of riots in 1820, after which the legislature formed a New York State Prison Guard for putting down future disturbances.&lt;ref name=autogenerated33&gt;Christianson, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials also began implementing a classification system at Auburn in the wake of the riots, dividing inmates into three groups: (1) the worst, who were placed on constant solitary lockdown; (2) middling offenders, who were kept in solitary and worked in groups when well-behaved; and (3) the &quot;least guilty and depraved,&quot; who were permitted to sleep in solitary and work in groups.&lt;ref name=autogenerated33 /&gt; Construction on a new solitary cell block for category (1) inmates ended in December 1821, after which these &quot;hardened&quot; offenders moved into their new home.&lt;ref name=autogenerated33 /&gt; Within a little over a year, however, five of these men had died of consumption, another forty-one were seriously ill, and several had gone insane.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25&gt;Christianson, 114.&lt;/ref&gt; After visiting the prison and seeing the residents of the new cell block, Governor [[Joseph C. Yates]] was so appalled by their condition that he pardoned several of them outright.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25 /&gt;

[[File:JosephCYates.jpg|thumb|right|180px|When [[Joseph C. Yates]] visited solitary cells at the [[Auburn Correctional Facility|Auburn Penitentiary]] in the early 1820s, he pardoned several inmates on the spot to spare them further confinement at the prison.]]

Scandal struck Auburn again when a female inmate became pregnant in solitary confinement and, later, died after repeated beatings and the onset of pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; (Because Auburn relied on female inmates for its washing and cleaning services, women remained part of the population but the first separate women's institution in New York was not completed until 1893.)&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; A jury convicted the keeper who beat the woman of assault and battery, and fined him $25, but he remained on the job.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Christianson, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; A grand jury investigation into other aspects of the prison's management followed but was hampered, among other obstacles, by the fact that convicts could not present evidence in court.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; Even so, the grand jury eventually concluded that Auburn's keepers had been permitted to flog inmates without a higher official present, a violation of state law. But neither the warden nor any other officer was ever prosecuted, and the use and intensity of flogging only increased at Auburn, as well as the newer [[Sing Sing]] prison, in subsequent years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

Despite its early scandals and regular political power struggles that left it with an unstable administrative structure,&lt;ref name=autogenerated118 /&gt; Auburn remained a model institution nationwide for decades to come.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Rothman, ''Discovery'', 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts]] opened a new prison in 1826 modeled on the Auburn system, and within the first decade of Auburn's existence, [[New Hampshire]], [[Vermont]], [[Maryland]], [[Kentucky]], [[Ohio]], [[Tennessee]], and the [[District of Columbia]] all constructed prisons patterned on its congregate system.&lt;ref&gt;McKelvey, 11&lt;/ref&gt; By the eve of the [[American Civil War]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Missouri]], [[Mississippi]], [[Texas]], and [[Arkansas]], with varying success, had all inaugurated efforts to establish an Auburn-model prison in their jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;McKelvey, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread move to penitentiaries in the antebellum United States changed the geography of criminal punishment, as well as its central therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Offenders were now ferried across water or into walled compounds to centralized institutions of the criminal justice system hidden from public view.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 45; Meranze, 173–174; Rothman, ''Discovery'', 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; The penitentiary thus largely ended community involvement in the penal process—beyond a limited role in the criminal trial itself—though many prisons permitted visitors who paid a fee to view the inmates throughout the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The South====
On eve of [[American Civil War]], crime did not pose a major concern in the [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 141&quot;/&gt; Southerners in the main considered crime to be a Northern problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 141&quot;/&gt; A traditional extra-legal system of remedying slights, based in [[honor culture]] made personal violence the hallmark of Southern crime.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 141; Hindus, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Southern penitentiary systems brought only the most hardened criminals under centralized state control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 141&quot;/&gt; Most criminals remained outside of formal state control structures—especially outside of Southern cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 141&quot;/&gt;

=====Antebellum Southern republicanism and political opposition to penitentiary building=====
The historical record suggests that, in contrast to Northerners, Southernern states experienced a unique political anxiety about whether to construct prisons during the antebellum period.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements over [[republicanism|republican]] principles—''i.e.'', the role of the state in social governance—became the focus of a persistent debate about the necessity of southern penitentiaries in the decades between independence and the Civil War.&lt;ref name=autogenerated128&gt;Ayers, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

To many Southerners, writes historian [[Edward L. Ayers]], &quot;republicanism&quot; translated simply to freedom from the will of anyone else: Centralized power, even in the name of an activist republican government, promised more evil than good.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 141&quot;&gt;Ayers, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Ayers concludes that this form of Southern republicanism owed its particular shape to slavery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 141&quot;/&gt; The South's slave economy perpetuated a rural, localized culture, he argues, in which men distrusted strangers' claims to power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 141&quot;/&gt; In this political milieu, the notion of surrendering individual liberties of any kind—even those of criminals—for some abstract conception of &quot;social improvement&quot; was abhorrent to many.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 141&quot;/&gt;

But criminal incarceration appealed to others in the South. These Southerners believed that freedom would best grow under the protection of an enlightened state government that made the criminal law more effective by eradicating its more brutal practices and offering criminals the possibility of rehabilitation and restoration to society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated128 /&gt; Some also believed that penitentiaries would help to remove the contagion of depravity from republican society by segregating those who threatened the republican ideal (the &quot;disturbing class&quot;).&lt;ref name=autogenerated121&gt;Ayers, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Notions of living up to the world's ideas of &quot;progress&quot; also animated Southern penal reformers. When the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] legislature considered abolishing the state's penitentiary after a devastating fire in 1829, reformers there worried their state would become the first to renounce republican &quot;progress.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated43&gt;Ayers, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

A sizable portion of the Southern population—if not the majority—did not support the establishment of the penitentiary.&lt;ref name=autogenerated128 /&gt; Of the two times that voters in the region had an opportunity to express their opinion of the penitentiary system at the ballot box—in [[Alabama]] and [[North Carolina]]—the penitentiary lost overwhelmingly.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Some viewed traditional public punishments as the most republican mechanism for criminal justice, due to their inherent transparency.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Some worried that, since the quantity of suffering under penitentiary system would sure to far exceed that of the traditional system, Southern jurors would maintain their historic disposal toward acquittal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated43 /&gt; Evangelical Southern clergymen also opposed the penitentiary—especially when its implementation accompanied statutory restriction of the death penalty, which they deemed a biblical requirement for certain crimes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated105&gt;Ayers, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the penitentiary crossed party lines; neither the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] nor the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] lent consistent support to the institution in the antebellum period.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; But consistent and enthusiastic support for the penitentiary did come, almost uniformly, from Southern governors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated61&gt;Ayers, 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; The motives of these governors are note entirely unclear, historian [[Edward L. Ayers]] concludes: Perhaps they hoped that the additional patronage positions offered by a penitentiary would augment the historically weak power of the Southern executive; perhaps they were legitimately concerned with the problem of crime; or perhaps both considerations played a role.&lt;ref name=autogenerated61 /&gt; Grand juries—drawn from Southern &quot;elites&quot;—also issued regular calls for penitentiaries in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the penitentiary's supporters prevailed in the South, as in the North. Southern legislators enacted prison legislation in state after Southern state before the Civil War, often over public opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Their motives in doing so appear mixed. According to [[Edward L. Ayers]], some Southern legislators appear to have believed they knew what was best for their people in any case.&lt;ref name=autogenerated78&gt;Ayers, 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Since many Southern legislators came from the elite classes, Ayers also observes, they may also have had a personal &quot;class control&quot; motive for enacting penitentiary legislation, even while they could point to their participation in penitentiary efforts as evidence of their own benevolence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated78 /&gt; Historian Michael S. Hindus concludes that Southern hesitation about the penitentiary, at least in South Carolina, stemmed from the slave system, which made the creation of a white criminal underclass undesirable.&lt;ref&gt;Hindus, 242–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Prison construction=====
Southern states erected penitentiaries alongside their Northern counterparts in the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Ayers, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia]] (1796), [[Maryland]] (1829), [[Tennessee]] (1831), [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (1832), [[Louisiana]] and [[Missouri]] (1834–1837), and [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]] (1837–1842) all erected penitentiary facilities during the antebellum period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Only the [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]] and largely uninhabited [[Florida]] failed to build any penitentiary before the Civil War&lt;ref name=autogenerated107&gt;Ayers, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Virginia]] was the first state after [[Pennsylvania]], in 1796, to dramatically reduce the number of crimes punishable by death, and its legislators simultaneously called for the construction of a &quot;gaol and penitentiary house&quot; as the cornerstone of a new criminal justice regime.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14&gt;Ayers, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], the state's first prison at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] resembled [[Jeremy Bentham|Jeremy Bentham's]] [[Panopticon]] design (as well as the not-yet-built [[Eastern State Penitentiary|Eastern State Penitentiary's]]).&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; All inmates served a mandatory period of solitary confinement after initial entry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt;

Unfortunately for its inhabitants, the site at Richmond where Virginia's first penitentiary was built bordered a stagnant pool, in which sewage collected.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; The prison's cells had no heating system and water oozed from its walls, leading inmates' extremities to freeze during the winter months.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; Prisoners could perform no work during the solitary portion of their sentence, which they served completely isolated in near-total darkness, and many went mad during this portion of their sentence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; Those prisoners who survived the isolation period joined other inmates in the prison workshop to make goods for the state militia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; The workshop never turned a profit.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; Escapes were common.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

But despite Virginia's example, [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] all constructed prisons before 1820, and the trend continued in the South thereafter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt; Early Southern prisons were marked by escapes, violence, and arson.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15&gt;Ayers, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The personal reformation of inmates was left almost solely to underpaid prison chaplains.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15&gt;Ayers, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Bitter opposition from the public and rampant overcrowding both marked Southern penal systems during the antebellum period. But once established, southern penitentiaries took on lives of their own, with each state's system experiencing a complex history of innovation and stagnation, efficient and inefficient wardens, relative prosperity and poverty, fires, escapes, and legislative attacks; but they did follow a common trajectory.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15 /&gt;

During the period in which slavery existed, few black Southerners in the lower South were imprisoned, and virtually none of those imprisoned were slaves.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24&gt;Ayers, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, slaves accused of crimes—especially less serious offenses—were tried informally in extra-legal plantation &quot;courts,&quot; although it was not uncommon for slaves to come within the formal jurisdiction of the Southern courts.&lt;ref&gt;Hindus, 137&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Southern inmates during the antebellum period were foreign-born whites.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24 /&gt; Nevertheless, in the upper South, free blacks made up a significant (and disproportionate) one-third of state prison populations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated137&gt;Ayers, 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; Governors and legislators in both the upper and lower South became concerned about racial mixing in their prison systems.&lt;ref name=autogenerated137 /&gt; Virginia experimented for a time with selling free blacks convicted of &quot;serious&quot; crimes into slavery until public opposition led to the measure's repeal (but only after forty such persons were sold).&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few women, black or white, were imprisoned in the antebellum South.&lt;ref name=autogenerated114&gt;Ayers, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; But for those women who did come under the control of Southern prisons, conditions were often &quot;horrendous,&quot; according to [[Edward L. Ayers]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated114 /&gt; Although they were not made to shave their heads like male convicts, female inmates in the antebellum South did not live in specialized facilities—as was the case in many antebellum Northern prisons—and sexual abuse was common.&lt;ref name=autogenerated114 /&gt;

As in the North, the costs of imprisonment preoccupied Southern authorities, although it appears that Southerners devoted more concern to this problem than their Northern counterparts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated120&gt;Ayers, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Southern governors of the antebellum period tended to have little patience for prisons that did not turn a profit or, at least, break even.&lt;ref name=autogenerated120 /&gt; Southern prisons adopted many of the same money-making tactics as their Northern counterparts. Prisons earned money by charging fees to visitors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;Ayers, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; They also earned money by harnessing convict labor to produce simple goods that were in steady demand, like slave shoes, wagons, pails, and bricks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt; But this fomented unrest among workers and tradesmen in Southern towns and cities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt; Governor [[Andrew Johnson]] of Tennessee, a former tailor, waged political war on his state's penitentiary and the industries it had introduced among its inmates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated60&gt;Ayers, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid these conflicts, some states—like Georgia and Mississippi—experimented with prison industry for state-run enterprises.&lt;ref name=autogenerated60 /&gt; But in the end few penitentiaries, North or South, turned a profit during the antebellum period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated60 /&gt;

Presaging Reconstruction-era developments, however, [[Virginia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Tennessee]] began considering the idea of leasing their convicts to private businesspersons by the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners in [[Missouri]], [[Alabama]], [[Texas]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Louisiana]] all leased their convicts during the antebellum period under a variety of arrangements—some inside the prison itself (as Northern prisons were also doing), and others outside of the state's own facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Urban crime in the antebellum South=====
Between 1800 and 1860, the vast majority of the Southern population worked in agriculture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated74&gt;McPherson, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the proportion of the Northern population working on farms dropped in this period from 70 to 40 percent, 80 percent of Southerners were consistently engaged in farm-related work.&lt;ref name=autogenerated74 /&gt; Reflecting this, only one-tenth of Southerners lived in what the contemporary census criteria described as an urban area (compared to nearly one-quarter of Northerners).&lt;ref name=autogenerated74 /&gt;

Antebellum southern cities stood at juncture of the region's slave economy and the international market economy, and economics appear to have played crucial role in shaping the face of crime in Southern cities.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; These urban centers tended to attract young and propertyless white males, not only from the Southern countryside, but also from the North and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Urban immigration in the South reached a peak during the 1850s, when an economic boom in cotton produced &quot;flush times.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Poor young men and others—white and black—settled on the peripheries of Southern cities like [[Savannah, Georgia]]. Here they came into contact with the wealthy and more stable elements of modern society,&lt;ref name=autogenerated42&gt;Ayers, 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; producing demographics similar to those in post-revolutionary Philadelphia and other Northern cities.&lt;ref&gt;Meranze, 67—68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first modern Southern police forces emerged between 1845 and the Civil War in large part due to the class-based tensions that developed in Southern cities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated42 /&gt; Some Southern cities—notably New Orleans and Charleston—experimented with police forces even earlier in the eighteenth century as a means of controlling their large urban slave populations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated99&gt;Ayers, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; But most Southern cities relied on volunteer night-watch forces prior to mid-century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated99 /&gt; The transition to uniformed police forces was not especially smooth: Major political opposition arose as a result of the perceived corruption, inefficiency, and threat to individual liberty posed by the new police.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 87–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Edward L. Ayers]], Southern police forces of the antebellum period tended to enforce uniformity by creating crime out of &quot;disorder&quot; and &quot;nuisance&quot; enforcement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 90&quot;&gt;Ayers, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of theft prosecutions in the antebellum South arose in its cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 90&quot;/&gt; And property offenders made up a disproportionate share of the convict population. Although thieves and burglars constituted fewer than 20 percent of the criminals convicted in Southern courts, they made up about half the South's prison population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated30&gt;Ayers, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period between independence and the Civil War, Southern inmates were disproportionately ethnic.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 53–55&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign-born persons made up less than 3 percent of the South's free population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated30 /&gt; In fact, only one-eighth of all immigrants to the United States during the antebellum period settled in the South.&lt;ref name=autogenerated74 /&gt; Yet foreign immigrants represented anywhere from 8 to 37 percent of the prison population of the Southern states during this period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated30 /&gt;

Crime in Southern cities generally mirrored that of Northern ones during the antebellum years. Both sections experienced a spike in imprisonment rates during a national market depression on the eve of the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated83&gt;Ayers, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The North had experienced a similar depression during the 1830s and 1840s—with a concurrent increase in imprisonment—that the agrarian South did not.&lt;ref name=autogenerated83 /&gt; But urban crime in the South differed from that in the North in one key way—its violence. A significantly higher percentage of violence characterized Southern criminal offenders of all class levels.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 99; Hindus, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Young white males made up the bulk of violent offenders in the urban South.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery in the urban South also played a role in the development of its penal institutions. Urban slave-owners often utilized jails to &quot;store&quot; their human property and to punish slaves for disciplinary infractions.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaveholding in urban areas tended to be less rigid than in the rural South. Nearly 60 percent of slaves living in Savannah, Georgia, for example, did not reside with their master; many were allowed to hire themselves out for wages (though they had to share the proceeds with their owner).&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Ayers, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In this environment, where racial control was more difficult to enforce, Southern whites were constantly on guard against black criminality.&lt;ref name=autogenerated111&gt;Ayers, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charleston, South Carolina]], established a specialized workhouse for masters to send their slaves for punishment for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;Hindus, 146–49.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Savannah, Georgia]], owners could send their slaves to the city jail to have punishment administered.&lt;ref&gt;Hindus, 147 n.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Rural crime in the antebellum South=====
Industrialization proceeded haphazardly across the South during the antebellum period, and large sections of the rural population participated in a subsistence economy like that of the colonial era.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 14—15.&lt;/ref&gt; Patterns of crime in these regions reflected these economic realities; violence, not thefts, took up most of the docket space in rural Southern courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 109, 111; Hindus, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike antebellum urban spaces, the ups and downs of the market economy had a lesser impact on crime in the South's rural areas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated44&gt;Ayers, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Far fewer theft cases appear on criminal dockets in the rural antebellum South than in its cities (though rural judges and juries, like their urban counterparts, dealt with property offenders more harshly than violent ones).&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 109, 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Crime in rural area areas consisted almost solely of violent offenses.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Most counties in the antebellum South—as in the North—maintained a jail for housing pre-trial and pre-sentence detainees.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; These varied in size and quality of construction considerably as a result of disparities in wealth between various counties.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 109–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Southern cities, however, rural counties rarely used the jail as criminal punishment in the antebellum period, even as states across the Northeast and the Midwest shifted the focus of their criminal justice process to rehabilitative incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, fines were the mainstay of rural Southern justice.&lt;ref name=autogenerated69&gt;Ayers, 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-use of imprisonment as a criminal punishment in the rural antebellum South reflected the haphazard administration of criminal justice in these regions. Under the general [[criminal procedure]] of the day, victims of theft or violence swore out complaints before their local [[justice of the peace]], who in turn issued [[arrest warrant]]s for the accused.&lt;ref name=autogenerated44 /&gt; The county [[sheriff]] would execute the warrant and bring the defendant before a [[magistrate]] judge, who would conduct a [[preliminary hearing]], after which he could either dismiss the case or bind the accused over to the Superior Court for a [[grand jury]] hearing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated44 /&gt; (Some cases, however, particularly those involving moral offenses like drinking and gambling, were initiated by the [[grand jury]] of its own accord.)&lt;ref name=autogenerated44 /&gt;

Criminal procedure in the antebellum rural South offered many avenues of escape to a criminal defendant, and only the poorest resided in the jail while awaiting trial or sentencing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated44 /&gt; Those defendants who did spend time in jail before trial had to wait for the prosecutor's biannual visit to their county.&lt;ref name=autogenerated109&gt;Ayers, 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Southern prosecutors generally did not live in the local area where they prosecuted cases and were generally ill-prepared.&lt;ref name=autogenerated109 /&gt; Disinterested jurors were also hard to come by, given the generally intimate nature of rural Southern communities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;Ayers, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Relative leniency in sentencing for appears to have marked most judicial proceedings for violent offenses—the most common.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Historical evidence suggests that juries indicted a greater number of potential offenders than the judicial system could handle in the belief that many troublemakers—especially the landless—would leave the country altogether.&lt;ref name=autogenerated69 /&gt;

Few immigrants or free blacks lived in the rural South in the pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] years,&lt;ref name=autogenerated127&gt;Ayers, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; and slaves remained under the dominant control of a separate criminal justice system administered by planters throughout the period.&lt;ref&gt;Hindus, 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, most criminal defendants were Southern-born whites (and all socio-economic classes were represented on criminal dockets).&lt;ref name=autogenerated127 /&gt; Blacks occasionally came within the purview of the conventional criminal justice apparatus from their dealings with whites in the &quot;gray market,&quot; among other offenses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated123&gt;Ayers, 131.&lt;/ref&gt; But the danger to whites and blacks alike from illicit trading, the violence that often erupted at their meetings, and the tendency of whites to take advantage of their legally impotent black counterparties all made these occurrences relatively rare.&lt;ref name=autogenerated123 /&gt;

===Reconstruction era===
The [[American Civil War]] and its aftermath witnessed renewed efforts to reform America's system and rationale for imprisonment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated45&gt;Christianson, 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Most state prisons remained unchanged since the wave of [[Prison|penitentiary]] building during the [[Jacksonian Era]] and, as a result, were in a state of physical and administrative deterioration.&lt;ref name=autogenerated45 /&gt; [[Auburn Prison|Auburn]] and [[Eastern State Penitentiary|Eastern State]] penitentiaries, the paradigmatic prisons of Jacksonian reform, were little different.&lt;ref name=autogenerated45 /&gt; New reformers confronted the problems of decaying antebellum prisons with a new penal regime that focused on the rehabilitation of the individual—this time with an emphasis on using institutional inducements as a means of affecting behavioral change. At the same time, Reconstruction-era penology also focused on emerging &quot;scientific&quot; views of criminality related to [[race (human classification)|race]] and [[heredity]], as the post-war years witnessed the birth of a [[eugenics]] movement in the United States.

====Northern developments====

=====Brutality, immigration, eugenics, and &quot;prisons as laboratories&quot;=====
Social historian [[David Rothman]] describes the story of post-reconstruction prison administration as one of decline from the ambitions [[Jacksonian Era|Jacksonian period]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Facing major overcrowding and understaffing issues, prison officials reverted to &quot;amazingly bizarre&quot; methods of controlling their charges, Rothman writes.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the punishments that proliferated in this period were:
* '''The Pulley or Tying Up'''—Convicts were suspended by the wrists, fastened over their head, for anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. At [[Sing Sing]] Prison, where this treatment was especially popular a New York investigator related, &quot;Men have been kept raised so long as to cause bleeding from the mouth, before the doctor would order the prisoner taken down.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Rothman, ''Conscience'', 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Wardens also used a variation on the pulley known as the &quot;hooks,&quot; which involved tying the inmates' hands together and lashing them to the wall at chest height, forcing them to put most of their weight onto their toes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Iron Cap or &quot;Cage&quot;'''—The convict wore a case composed of small rods or bands of iron—which weighed between 6 ½ and 8 pounds—around the neck, and an iron band across the next and shoulders held it in place.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;
* '''The Lash and Paddle'''—This traditional penitentiary punishment continued into the post-war era with some refinement—''i.e.'', weighted leather strips and aerated paddles were used instead of whips. The number of strokes was set to the offense and in some placed, like Massachusetts, limited by statute.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt; [[Sing Sing]] convicts in the 1880s reportedly jumped from the upper galleries of the prison's cell blocks in an effort to break their legs and escape a paddling.&lt;ref name=autogenerated52&gt;Christianson, 184&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Solitary Confinement (&quot;The Dungeon&quot;)'''—Reconstruction-era inmates were locked in dark solitary cells, furnished only with a bucket, and fed short rations for disciplinary infractions (usually for a period of up to a week, but sometimes up to six or more).&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;Rothman, Conscience, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Straitjackets'''—Wardens used these as much for discipline as for inmate safety.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;
* '''Brickbag'''—Convicts who would not work were forced in some institutions to wear a heavy bag (full of weighted objects).&lt;ref name=autogenerated56&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Water Crib'''—Used at the Reconstruction-era prison in [[Kansas]], this disciplinary instrument involved the inmate's being placed in a coffin-like box about six-and-a-half feet long, thirty inches wide, and three-feet deep. The inmate would lie face down, his or her hands cuffed behind the back, while keepers slowly filled the crib with water to simulate drowning.&lt;ref name=autogenerated56 /&gt;

Although wardens tended to believe these measures were necessary for control, contemporary observers generally found them &quot;unquestionably cruel and unusual,&quot; according to [[David Rothman|Rothman]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, Conscience, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern states continued to lease the labor of their convicts to private business interests in the post-war years. The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], adopted in 1865, expressly permitted slavery &quot;as a punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. amend. XIII.&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern prisons, the state generally housed and fed inmate laborers, while contractors brought all necessary machinery to the prison facility and leased the inmates' time.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 183–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abuses were common, according to investigative reporter Scott Christianson, as employers and guards tried to extract as much time and effort from prisoners as possible.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Christianson, 184.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[New Jersey|New Jersey's]] prison at [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], after an inmate died while being &quot;stretched&quot; by the prison staff, a committee investigating discipline at the prison determined that officials had poured alcohol on epileptics and set them on fire to see if they were faking convulsions in order to skip work.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson 184.&lt;/ref&gt; At an [[Ohio]] penitentiary, unproductive convicts were made to sit naked in puddles of water and receive electric shocks from an induction coil.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; In [[New York (state)|New York]], public investigations of practices in the state's prisons became increasingly frequent during the 1840s, 1860s, and 1870s—though with little actual effect on conditions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; They revealed that a prisoner had been poisoned to death for not working in one institution; another was found to have been kept chained to the floor for ten months in solitary confinement, until he eventually suffered a mental breakdown.&lt;ref name=autogenerated52 /&gt;

By and large, Americans of the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s did little to address the disciplinary and other abuses in United States penitentiaries of the time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated47&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 23.&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this apathy, according to authors Scott Christianson and [[David Rothman]], was the composition of contemporary prison populations. Following the Civil War, the volume of immigration to the United States increased alongside expanding nativist sentiment, which had been a fixture of national politics since long before the War.&lt;ref name=autogenerated125&gt;Christianson, 189; McPherson, 130–38.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1870s, as many as 3 million immigrants arrived on the shores of the United States. By the 1880s, the influx rose to 5.2 million, as immigrants fled persecution and unrest in eastern and southern Europe.&lt;ref name=autogenerated103&gt;Christianson, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend continued until immigration reached a zenith between 1904 and 1914 of 1 million persons per year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated103 /&gt;

Already in the 1850s and 1860s, prisons (along with [[mental asylum|asylums]] for the mentally ill) were becoming the special preserve of the foreign-born and the poor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated47 /&gt; This trend accelerated as the nineteenth century drew to a close.&lt;ref name=autogenerated47 /&gt; In [[Illinois]], for example, 60 percent of inmates in 1890 were foreign-born or second-generation immigrants—[[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Germans|German]], mostly.&lt;ref name=autogenerated47 /&gt; Less than one-third of the [[Illinois]] inmates had completed grammar school, only 5 percent had a high school or college education, and the great majority held unskilled or semi-skilled jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s [[California]], 45 percent of prisoners were foreign-born—predominantly of Chinese, Mexican, Irish, and German descent—and the majority were laborers, waiters, cooks, or farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the post-war years, the rate of imprisonment for foreign-born Americans was twice that of native-born ones; black Americans were incarcerated, North and South, at three times the rate of white Americans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated103 /&gt;

The Civil War's end also witnessed the emergence of pseudo-scientific theories concerning biological superiority and inherited social inferiority.&lt;ref name=autogenerated125 /&gt; Commentators grafted the [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] concept of &quot;[[survival of the fittest]]&quot; onto notions of [[social Darwinism|social class]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated103 /&gt; [[Charles Loring Brace]], author of ''The Dangerous Classes of New York'' (1872), warned his readers that attempts to cure poverty through charity would backfire by lessening the poor's chance of survival.&lt;ref name=autogenerated125 /&gt; Richard L. Dugdale, civic-minded New York merchant, toured thirteen county jails during the 1870s as a voluntary inspector for the prestigious Prison Association of New York. Reflecting on his observations in later writings, Dugdale traced crime to hereditary criminality and promiscuity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated125 /&gt;

These views on race and genetics, Christianson and [[David Rothman|Rothman]] conclude, affected the various official supervisory bodies established to monitor regulatory compliance in United States prisons.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 25; Christianson, 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these monitoring boards (established either by the state executive or legislature) would ostensibly ferret out abuses in the prison system, in the end their apathy toward the incarcerated population rendered them largely ill-equipped for task of ensuring even humane care, [[David Rothman|Rothman]] argues.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 25&lt;/ref&gt; State and federal judges, for their part, refrained from monitoring prison conditions until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk, 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Persistent beliefs in inherited criminality and social inferiority also stoked a growing [[eugenics]] movement during the [[Reconstruction Era]], which sought to &quot;improve&quot; the human race through controlled breeding and eliminate &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;inferior&quot; tendencies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated103 /&gt; By the late 1890s, [[eugenics]] programs were enjoying a &quot;full-blown renaissance&quot; in American prisons and institutions for the mentally ill, with leading physicians, psychologists, and wardens as proponents.&lt;ref name=autogenerated103 /&gt; Italian criminologist [[Cesare Lombroso]] published a highly influential tract in 1878 entitled ''L'uomo delinquente'' (or, ''The Criminal Man''), which theorized that a primitive criminal type existed who was identifiable by physical symptoms or &quot;stigmata.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phrenology]] also became a popular &quot;science&quot; among prison officials; at the height of the study's popularity, the influential [[Reconstruction Era]] matron of [[Sing Sing Prison]], Elizabeth W. Farnham, was one of its adherents, and officials at [[Eastern State Penitentiary]] maintained phrenological data on all inmates during the post-war years.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 191–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the field of [[physical anthropology]] gained traction in the 1880s, prisons became laboratories for studying [[eugenics]], [[psychology]], [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]], [[medicine]], [[drug rehabilitation|drug treatment]], [[genetics]], and [[birth control]].&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 192 (citing several examples).&lt;/ref&gt; Support for these initiatives sprang from the influential prison reform organizations in the United States at the time—''e.g.'', the Prison Reform Congress, the National Conference for Charities and Corrections, the National Prison Congress, the Prison Association of New York, and the Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

New methods of identifying criminal tendencies and classifying offenders by threat level emerged from prison-based research.&lt;ref name=autogenerated91&gt;Christianson, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, for instance, [[New York (state)|New York]] began requiring all persons sentenced to a penal institution for thirty days or more to be measured and photographed for state records.&lt;ref name=autogenerated91 /&gt; [[Eugenics]] studies in the prison setting led to the development of the [[vasectomy]] as a replacement for total [[castration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Christianson, 195&quot;&gt;Christianson, 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugenics]] studies of the day aimed to prevent the extinction or genetic deterioration of mankind through restraints on reproduction, according to author Scott Christianson.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Christianson, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1890s, the [[Kansas]] &quot;Home for the Feeble-Minded&quot; began performing mass castrations on all of its residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christianson, 195&quot;/&gt; And [[Indiana]] became the first state to enact a compulsory sterilization act for certain mentally ill and criminal persons in 1907.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], a [[eugenics]] devotee, became involved in [[social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] experiments in [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In the 1910s, Rockefeller created the Bureau for Social Hygiene, which conducted experiments on female prisoners, with the state's consent and financial support, to determine the roots of their criminality and &quot;mental defectiveness.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=====Failure of Jacksonian reform and renewed efforts=====
A new group of prison reformers emerged in the [[Reconstruction Era]] that maintained some optimism about the institution and initiated efforts to make the prison a center for moral [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]]. Their efforts led to some change in contemporary prisons, but it would take another period of reform during the [[Progressive Era]] for any significant structural revisions to the prison systems of the United States.

The primary failure of [[Reconstruction Era]] penitentiaries, according to historian [[David Rothman]], was administrative. State governors typically appointed political patrons to prison posts, which were usually not full-time or salaried.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothman, Conscience, 25&quot;&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1870s, for example, the board of the [[Utica, New York]], asylum was composed of two bankers, a grain merchant, two manufacturers, two lawyers, and two general businessman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothman, Conscience, 25&quot;/&gt; Prison oversight boards like the Utica one, composed of local businessmen, tended to defer to prison officials in most matters and focus solely on financial oversight, [[David Rothman|Rothman]] writes,&lt;ref name=autogenerated131&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 26.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore tended to perpetuate the status quo.&lt;ref name=autogenerated98&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prison reform efforts of the [[Reconstruction Era]] came from a variety of sources. Fears about genetic contamination by the &quot;criminal class&quot; and its effect on the future of mankind led to numerous moral policing efforts aimed at curbing [[promiscuity]], [[prostitution]], and [[Sexual slavery|&quot;white slavery&quot;]] in this period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Meanwhile, campaigns to criminalize [[domestic violence]], especially toward children, and related [[temperance movement|temperance]] movements led to renewed commitment to &quot;law and order&quot; in many communities from the 1870s onward.&lt;ref name=autogenerated34&gt;Gottschalk, 118–21.&lt;/ref&gt; When legislators ignored demands for more protection for women and children, [[feminism|feminist]] activists lobbied for harsher punishments for male criminal offenders—including the [[Flagellation|whipping]] post, [[castration]], and longer prison terms.&lt;ref name=autogenerated34 /&gt;

Another group of reformers continued to justify penitentiaries for negative reasons—''i.e.'', for fear that a sustained and successful attack on the prison system and its failings might yield a return to the &quot;barbarism&quot; of colonial-era punishments.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a degree of optimism continued to dominate the thinking of reformers in the post-Civil War period, according to historian [[David Rothman]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 1870, notable [[Reconstruction Era]] prison reformers [[Enoch Wines]], [[Franklin Sanborn]], [[Theodore William Dwight|Theodore Dwight]], and [[Zebulon Brockway]]—among others—convened with the National Congress of Penitentiary and Reformatory Discipline in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. The resolutions that emerged from the conference, called the ''Declaration of Principles'', became the chief planks of the [[Prison|penitentiary]] reform agenda in the United States for the next several decades.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 31; Christianson, 177&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of the National Congress' agenda in the ''Declaration'' was a renewed commitment to the &quot;moral regeneration&quot; of offenders (especially young ones) through a new model of penitentiary.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 31; Christianson, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Congress' ''Declaration of Principles'' characterized crime as &quot;a sort of moral disease.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Declaration'' stated that the &quot;great object [of] . . . the treatment of criminals . . . should be [their] moral regeneration . . . the reformation of criminals, not the infliction of vindictive suffering.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Rothman, ''Conscience'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration took inspiration from the &quot;Irish mark system&quot; pioneered by [[penology|penologist]] Sir Walter Crofton. The object of Crofton's system was to teach prisoners how to lead an upright life through use of &quot;good-time&quot; credits (for early release) and other behavioral incentives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated45 /&gt; The ''Declaration'''s primary goals were: (1) to cultivate prisoners' sense of self-respect; and (2) to place the prisoner's destiny in his or her own hands.&lt;ref name=autogenerated36&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 32.&lt;/ref&gt; But the ''Declaration'' more broadly:
* Called for [[sanitation|sanitary]] improvements and an end to the political appointment of prison administrators;
* Welcomed the increased participation of women in prison management;
* Advocated for a more progressive system of classifying prisoners based on individualized and continuous assessments of their character through a mark system;
* Stressed the importance of educating inmates; and
* Argued that prisoners' wills must be won over via persuasion, not destroyed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated70&gt;Christianson, 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Congress and those who responded to its agenda also hoped to implement a more open-ended sentencing code. They advocated for the replacement of the peremptory (or mandatory) sentences of the day, set by a judge after trial, with sentences of indeterminate length.&lt;ref name=autogenerated36 /&gt; True &quot;proof of reformation,&quot; the Congress Declaration provided, should replace the &quot;mere lapse of time&quot; in winning an inmate's release from confinement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated36 /&gt; These suggestions anticipated the near-comprehensive adoption of indeterminate sentencing during the [[Progressive Era]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Rothman, ''Conscience'', 44, 68–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of its many &quot;progressive&quot; suggestions for penal reform, the National Congress showed little sensitivity to the plight of freed blacks and immigrants in the penal system, in the view of author Scott Christianson.&lt;ref name=autogenerated70 /&gt; Christianson notes that the National Congress' membership generally subscribed to the prevailing contemporary notion that blacks and foreigners were disproportionately represented in the prison system due to their inherent depravity and social inferiority.&lt;ref name=autogenerated70 /&gt;

The rise and decline of the [[Elmira Reformatory]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] during the latter part of the nineteenth century represents the most ambitious attempt in the [[Reconstruction Era]] to fulfill the goals set by the National Congress in the ''Declaration of Principles''.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 179; Rothman, ''Conscience'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Built in 1876, the Elmira institution was designed to hold first-time felons, between the ages of sixteen and thirty, who were serving an indeterminate term of imprisonment set by their sentencing judge.&lt;ref name=autogenerated62&gt;Christianson, 179; Rothman, ''Conscience'', 33&lt;/ref&gt; Elmira inmates had to earn their way out of the institution through good behavior, as assessed through an elaborate grading system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated62 /&gt; The only limits on inmates' terms of imprisonment were whatever upper threshold the legislature set for their offense.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elmira's administration underscores the fundamental tension of contemporary penal reform, according to authors Scott Christianson and [[David Rothman]]. On the one hand, its purpose was to rehabilitate offenders; on the other, its reform principles were tempered by a belief in the heretability of criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 179; Rothman, ''Conscience'', 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Elmira's first warden, National Congress member [[Zebulon Brockway]], wrote in 1884 that at least one-half of his charges were &quot;incorrigible&quot; due to their genetics.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Brockway further characterized modern criminals as &quot;to a considerable extent the product of our civilization and . . . of emigration to our shore from the degenerated populations of crowded European marts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Christianson, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Brockway reserved the harshest disciplinary measures—''e.g.'', frequent whippings and solitary confinement—for those he deemed &quot;incorrigible&quot; (primarily the mentally and physically disabled).&lt;ref name=autogenerated23&gt;Christianson, 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elmira was regarded by many contemporaries as a well-run, model institution in its early years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated23 /&gt; Nevertheless, by 1893 the reformatory was seriously overcrowded and Brockway's ideas about genetic degeneracy, low-intelligence, and criminality came under fire as a result of his brutality toward the mentally and physically disabled.&lt;ref name=autogenerated23 /&gt; An 1894 executive investigation of Elmira's disciplinary practices concluded that discipline in the institution was harsh, although it eventually cleared Brockway of charges that he practiced &quot;cruel, brutal, excessive, degrading and unusual punishment of inmates.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 36; Christianson, 181.&lt;/ref&gt; But continuing stigma led the Brockway to resign from his post at Elmira by 1900.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

Historian [[David Rothman]] characterizes Brockway's departure from Elmira as marking the institution's failure as a reformed penitentiary, since its methods were hardly different from those of other [[Jacksonian Era]] institutions that had survived into the post-war years. But [[David Rothman|Rothman]] also concludes that the Elmira experience suggested to contemporary reformers only that management was to blame, not their proposed system of incarceration generally.&lt;ref name=autogenerated57&gt;Rothman, ''Conscience'', 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The Progressive Era of the early twentieth century thus witnessed renewed efforts to implement the penal agenda espoused by the National Congress and its adherents in 1870—albeit with some noteworthy structural additions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated57 /&gt;

====Southern developments====
The Civil War brought overwhelming change to Southern society and its criminal justice system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 141&quot;/&gt; As freed slaves joined the Southern population, they came under the primary control of local governments for the first time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Ayers, 142.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the market economy began to affect individuals and regions in [[Southern United States|the South]] that were previously untouched.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Widespread poverty at the end of the nineteenth century unraveled the South's prior race-based social fabric.&lt;ref name=autogenerated87&gt;Ayers, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; In Reconstruction-era cities like Savannah, Georgia, intricate codes of racial etiquette began to unravel almost immediately after the war with the onset of [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated87 /&gt; The local police forces that had been available in the antebellum South, depleted during the war, could not enforce the racial order as they had before.&lt;ref name=autogenerated87 /&gt; Nor was the white population, stricken by poverty and resentment, as united in its racial policing as it was during the antebellum period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated87 /&gt; By the end of Reconstruction, a new configuration of crime and punishment had emerged in the South: a hybrid, racialized form of incarceration at hard labor, with convicts leased to private businesses, that endured well into the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 142; ''see also'' Blackmon.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Changing demographics of crime and punishment in the Reconstruction-era South=====
The economic turmoil of the post-[[American Civil War|war]] South reconstituted race relations and the nature of crime in the region, as whites attempted to reassert their supremacy. Earlier, extra-legal efforts toward reestablishing [[white supremacy]], like those of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], gradually gave way to more certain and less volatile forms of race control, according to historian [[Edward L. Ayers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 183&lt;/ref&gt; Racial animosity and hatred grew as the races became ever more separate, [[Edward L. Ayers|Ayers]] argues, and Southern legal institutions turned much of their attention to preserving the racial ''status quo'' for whites.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterns of &quot;mono-racial law enforcement,&quot; as [[Edward L. Ayers|Ayers]] refers to it, were established in Southern states almost immediately after the [[American Civil War]]. Cities that had never had [[police]] forces moved quickly to establish them,&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 175–76&lt;/ref&gt; and whites became far less critical of urban police forces in post-war politics, whereas in the antebellum period they had engendered major political debate.&lt;ref name=autogenerated94&gt;Ayers, 173&lt;/ref&gt; [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah, Georgia's]] post-war police force was made up of [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] veterans, who patrolled the city in gray uniforms, armed with rifles, revolvers, and sabers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated94 /&gt; They were led by an ex-Confederate General, [[Richard H. Anderson]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated94 /&gt; [[Edward L. Ayers|Ayers]] concludes that white policemen protecting white citizens became the model for law enforcement efforts across [[Southern United States|the South]] after the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated94 /&gt;

Depressed economic conditions impacted both white and black farmers in the post-war South, as cotton prices entered a worldwide decline and interest rates on personal debt rose with &quot;astonishing&quot; speed after the close of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 166–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Property crime convictions in the Southern countryside, rare in the antebellum years, rose precipitously throughout the 1870s (though violent crime by white offenders continued to take up the majority of the rural courts' business).&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 168—69&lt;/ref&gt;

Former slaves who migrated to Southern cities, where they often received the lowest-paying jobs, were generally affected more acutely by economic downturns than their rural counterparts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated110&gt;Ayers, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Five years after the Civil War, 90 percent of the black population of Savannah, Georgia, owned no property.&lt;ref name=autogenerated110 /&gt; Increases in black property crime prosecutions in Savannah correlate to major economic downturns of the post-war period.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 172–73&lt;/ref&gt;

Whites made few attempts to disguise the injustice in their courts, according to historian [[Edward L. Ayers]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated73&gt;Ayers, 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Blacks were uniformly excluded from juries and denied any opportunity to participate in the criminal justice process aside from being defendants.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 175–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Thefts by black offenders became a new focus of the Southern justice systems and began to supplant violent crimes by white offenders in court dockets. Whether they were from the city or the countryside, those accused of property crime stood the greatest chance of conviction in post-war southern courts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated96&gt;Ayers, 176&lt;/ref&gt; But black defendants were convicted in the highest numbers. During the last half of the nineteenth century, three out of every five white defendants accused of property crime in Southern courts were convicted, while four out of every five black defendants were.&lt;ref name=autogenerated96 /&gt; Conviction rates for whites, meanwhile, dropped substantially from antebellum levels throughout the last half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated41 /&gt;

This system of justice led, in the opinion of [[W.E.B. Du Bois]], to a system in which neither blacks nor whites respected the criminal justice system—whites because they were so rarely held accountable, and blacks because their own accountability felt so disproportionate.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Ayers, 183&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, thousands of black Southerners served long terms on chain gangs for petty theft and misdemeanors in the 1860s and 1870s, while thousands more went into the convict lease system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated73 /&gt;

In criminal sentencing, blacks were disproportionately sentenced to incarceration—whether to the chain gang, convict leasing operation, or penitentiary—in relation to their white peers. Black incarceration peaked before and after [[radical Reconstruction]], when Southern whites exercised virtually unchecked power and restored &quot;efficiency&quot; to the criminal courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 170.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 384 of [[North Carolina|North Carolina's]] 455 prisoners in 1874 were black, and in 1878 the proportion had increased slightly to 846 of 952.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 172&lt;/ref&gt; By 1871, 609 of [[Virginia|Virginia's]] 828 convicts in—including all but four of its sixty-seven female prisoners—were black.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 173&lt;/ref&gt; But this phenomenon was not specific to the South: The proportion of black inmates in Northern prisons was virtually identical to that in Southern prisons throughout the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural courts met so rarely in the post-war years that prisoners often sat in jails for months while awaiting trial, at the government's expense.&lt;ref name=autogenerated20&gt;Ayers, 177.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chain gang]]s emerged in the post-war years as an initial solution to this economic deficit.&lt;ref name=autogenerated20 /&gt; Urban and rural counties moved the locus of criminal punishment from municipalities and towns to the county and began to change the economics of punishment from a heavy expense to a source of public &quot;revenue&quot;—at least in terms of infrastructure improvements.&lt;ref name=autogenerated20 /&gt; Even misdemeanors could be turned to economic advantage; defendants were often sentenced to only a few on the chain gang, with an additional three to eight months tacked onto the sentence to cover &quot;costs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 178.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Southern economy foundered in the wake of the peculiar institution's destruction, and property crime rose, state governments increasingly explored the economic potential of convict labor throughout the Reconstruction period and into the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 182–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Institutional power struggles over the Southern justice apparatus=====
&quot;The most far-reaching change in the history of crime and punishment in the nineteenth-century South,&quot; according to historian [[Edward L. Ayers]], was &quot;the state's assumption of control over blacks from their ex-masters . . . .&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ayers 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The process by which this occurred was &quot;halting and tenuous,&quot; but the transition began the moment a master told his slaves they were free.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 150.&lt;/ref&gt; In this landscape, Ayers writes, the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] vied with Southern whites—through official government apparatuses and informal organizations like the [[Ku Klux Klan]]—over opposing notions of justice in the post-war [[Southern United States|South]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated22&gt;Ayers, 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern whites in the main tried to salvage as much of the antebellum order as possible in the wake of the [[American Civil War]], waiting to see what changes might be forced upon them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; The [[Black Codes (United States)|&quot;Black Codes&quot;]] enacted almost immediately after the war—[[Mississippi]] and [[South Carolina]] passed theirs as early as 1865—were an initial effort in this direction.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; Although they did not use racial terms, the Codes defined and punished a new crime, &quot;vagrancy,&quot; broadly enough to guarantee that most newly free black Americans would remain in a ''de facto'' condition of servitude.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; The Codes vested considerable discretion in local judges and juries to carry out this mission: County courts could choose lengths and types of punishment previously unavailable.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; The available punishments for vagrancy, arson, rape, and burglary in particular—thought by whites to be peculiarly black crimes—widened considerably in the post-war years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt;

Soon after hostilities officially ceased between the [[United States]] and the [[Confederate States of America]], black &quot;vagrants&quot; in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], were being fined and sent to the city workhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[San Antonio, Texas]], and [[Montgomery, Alabama]], free blacks were arrested, imprisoned, and put to work on the streets to pay for their own upkeep.&lt;ref name=autogenerated119&gt;Christianson, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; A Northern journalist who passed through [[Selma, Alabama]], immediately after of the [[American Civil War|war]], was told that no white man had ever been sentenced to the [[chain gang]], but that blacks were now being condemned to it for such &quot;crimes&quot; as &quot;using abusive language towards a white man&quot; or selling farm produce within the town limits.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Christianson, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time that [[Reconstruction Era]] [[Southern United States|Southern]] governments enacted the [[Black Codes (United States)|&quot;Black Codes&quot;]], they also began to change the nature of the state's penal machinery to make it into an economic development tool.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 172; Gottschalk, 47–52&lt;/ref&gt; Social historian Marie Gottschalk characterizes the use of penal labor by Southern state governments during the post-[[American Civil War|war]] years as an &quot;important bridge between an agricultural economy based on slavery and the industrialization and agricultural modernization of the New South.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gottschalk, 49&quot;&gt;Gottschalk, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many prisons in [[Southern United States|the South]] were in a state of disrepair by the end of the [[American Civil War]], and state budgets across the region were exhausted.&lt;ref name=autogenerated119 /&gt; [[Mississippi|Mississippi's]] [[Prison|penitentiary]], for instance, was devastated during the war, and its funds depleted. In 1867 the state's military government began leasing convicts to rebuild wrecked [[railroad]] and [[levee]]s within the state. By 1872, it began leasing convicts to [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]], a former [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] general and [[slave trader]], as well as the first [[Imperial Wizard]] of the then emerging [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 172 – 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Texas]] also experienced a major postwar depression, in the midst of which its legislators enacted tough new laws calling for forced inmate labor within prison walls and at other works of public utility outside of the state's detention facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 174&lt;/ref&gt; Soon Texas began leasing convicts to railroads, [[irrigation]] and navigation projects, and [[lead]], [[copper]], and [[iron]] mines.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Virginia]]'s prison at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] collapsed in the wake of the City's 1865 surrender, but occupying [[Union Army|Union forces]] rounded up as many convicts as they could in order to return them to work.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 173.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alabama]] began leasing out its [[Wetumpka Prison]] to private businessmen soon after the Civil War.&lt;ref name=autogenerated119 /&gt;

During the [[Reconstruction Era]], the [[North Carolina]] legislature authorized state judges to sentence offenders to work on [[chain gang]]s on county roads, railroads, or other internal improvements for a maximum term of one year—though escapees who were recaptured would have to serve double their original sentence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated119 /&gt; North Carolina had failed to erect a penitentiary in the antebellum period, and its legislators planned to build an [[Auburn Prison|Auburn]]-style penitentiary to replace the penal labor system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated119 /&gt; But graft and shady dealings soon rendered a new prison impracticable, and North Carolina convicts continued to be leased to railroad companies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated119 /&gt;

Freed blacks became the primary workers in the South's emerging penal labor system. Those accused of property crime—white or black—stood the greatest chance of conviction in post-war Southern courts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated41&gt;Ayers, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; But black property offenders were convicted more often than white ones—at a rate of eight convictions for every ten black defendants, compared to six of every ten white defendants.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, conviction rates for whites dropped substantially from antebellum levels during the [[Reconstruction Era]] and continued to decline throughout the last half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated41 /&gt;

The [[Freedmen's Bureau]], charged with implementing congressional reconstruction throughout the former Confederate states, was the primary political body that opposed the increasing racial overtones of Southern criminal justice during the [[Reconstruction Era]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated71&gt;Ayers, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau's mission reflected a strong faith in impersonal legalism, according to historian [[Edward L. Ayers]], and its agents were to act as guarantors of blacks' legal equality.&lt;ref name=autogenerated71 /&gt; The Bureau maintained courts in the South from 1865 to 1868 to adjudicate minor civil and criminal cases involving freed slaves.&lt;ref name=autogenerated71 /&gt; Ultimately, [[Edward L. Ayers|Ayers]] concludes, the [[Freedmen's Bureau|Bureau]] largely failed to protect freed slaves from crime and violence by whites, or from the injustices of the Southern legal system, although the Bureau did provide much needed services to freed slaves in the form of food, clothing, school support, and assistance in contracts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 155&quot;&gt;Ayers, 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] ''Herald'' more bluntly stated that the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] was no match for the &quot;Organic Law of the Land&quot; in the South, white supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Ayers, 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the rural [[Southern United States|South]], the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] was only as strong as its isolated agents, who were often unable to assert their will over that of the whites in their jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Manpower issues and local white resentment led to early compromises under which southern civilians were allowed to serve as [[magistrate]]s on the Freedmen's Courts, although the move was opposed by many former slaves.&lt;ref name=autogenerated71 /&gt;

In cities like [[Savannah, Georgia]], the Freedmen's Courts appeared even more disposed to enforcing the wishes of local whites, sentencing former slaves (and veterans of the [[Union Army]]) to [[chain gang]]s, [[corporal punishment]]s, and public shaming.&lt;ref name=autogenerated116&gt;Ayers, 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The Savannah Freedmen's Courts even approved arrests for such &quot;offenses&quot; as &quot;shouting at a religious colored meeting,&quot; or speaking disrespectfully to a white man.&lt;ref name=autogenerated116 /&gt;

The Bureau's influence on post-war patterns of crime and punishment was temporary and limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 164&quot;&gt;Ayers, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Congress believed that only its unprecedented federal intrusion into state affairs through the Bureau could bring true republicanism to the South, according to [[Edward L. Ayers]], but Southerners instinctively resented this as a grave violation of their own republican ideals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 164&quot;/&gt; Southerners had always tended to circumscribe the sphere of written, institutionalized law, [[Edward L. Ayers|Ayers]] argues, and once they began to associate it with outside oppression from the federal government, they saw little reason to respect it at all.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 155–56.&lt;/ref&gt; From this resentment, vigilante groups like the [[Ku Klux Klan]] arose in opposition to the [[Freedmen's Bureau|Bureau]] and its mission—though, in the words of [[Edward L. Ayers|Ayers]], the Klan was a &quot;relatively brief episode in a long history of post-war group violence in the South,&quot; where extralegal retribution was and continued to be a tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, former slaves in the Reconstruction-era South made efforts of their own to counteract white supremacist violence and injustice. In March 1866, Abraham Winfield and ten other black men petitioned the head of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[Freedmen's Bureau]] for relief from the oppression of the Bureau's Court in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]—especially for [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veterans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 155&quot;/&gt; In rural areas like [[Greene County, Georgia]], blacks met [[vigilante]] violence from whites with violence of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; But with the withdrawal of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] in 1868 and continuing political violence from whites, blacks ultimately lost this struggle, according to historian [[Edward L. Ayers]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated35&gt;Ayers, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Southern courts were largely unable—even they were willing—to bring whites to justice for violence against black Southerners.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early to mid-1870s, white political supremacy had been established anew across most of the South.&lt;ref name=autogenerated35 /&gt;

In Southern cities, a different form of violence emerged in the post-[[American Civil War|war]] years. Race riots erupted in Southern cities almost immediately after the war and continued for years afterward. Edward L. Ayers concludes that antebellum legal restraints on blacks and widespread poverty were the primary cause of many of these clashes.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Whites resented labor competition from blacks in the depressed post-war Southern economy, and police forces—many composed of unreconstructed Southerners—often resorted to violence. The ultimate goal for both blacks and whites was to obtain political power in the vacuum created by war and emancipation; again, blacks ultimately lost this struggle during the Reconstruction period.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 161–62&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Beginning of the convict lease system=====
Convict leasing, practiced in the North from the earliest days of the penitentiary movement, was taken up by Southern states in earnest following the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated89&gt;Christianson, 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of convict labor remained popular nationwide throughout the post-war period.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated89&quot;/&gt; An 1885 national survey reported that 138 institutions employed over 53,000 inmates in industries, who produced goods valued at $28.8 million.&lt;ref name=autogenerated39&gt;Christianson, 187&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was a relatively small sum in comparison to the estimated $5.4 billion in goods produced by free labor in 1880, prison labor was big business for those involved in particular industries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated39 /&gt;

But convict leasing in the post-war South came to play a more central role in crime and punishment than in the North, and it continued to do so with the approbation of the South's leading men until well into the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 186; ''see also generally'' Blackmon.&lt;/ref&gt; For over a half-century following the Civil War, convict camps dotted the Southern landscape, and thousands of men and women—most of them former slaves—passed years of their lives within the system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated84&gt;Christianson, 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Men with capital, from the North and the South, bought years of these convicts' lives and put them to work in large mining and railroad operations, as well as smaller everyday businesses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated84 /&gt; On average, the death rate in Southern leasing arrangements exceeded that in Northern prisons three-fold.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The convict lease, as practiced in the South, was not just a bald attempt by state governments to resurrect slavery, according to historians [[Edward L. Ayers]] and Marie Gottschalk. It reflected continuities in race relations, both argue, but it also reflected fundamental changes in the post-war Southern economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 185; Gottschalk, 47–52&quot;&gt;Ayers, 185; Gottschalk, 47–52.&lt;/ref&gt; For first time, millions of freed slaves came under the centralized control of state penal apparatuses; at the same time, nascent industrial capitalism in the South faced a shortage of both capital and labor.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 185; ''see also'' Gottschalk, 47–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Former slaves were the easiest Southern demographic to impress into service and adapt southern industries to these changes.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, however, the longest legacy of the system may be as symbol for white South's injustice and inhumanity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated140&gt;Ayers, 186.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, Dr. E. Stagg of the National Commission on Prison Labor described the status of the Southern convict as &quot;the last surviving vestige of the slave system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 182&lt;/ref&gt; A Northern writer in the 1920s referred to the Southern [[chain gang]] as the South's new &quot;[[peculiar institution]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Christianson, 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern penitentiaries from the antebellum period by and large continued to fall into disrepair in the post-war years as they became mere outposts of the much larger convict labor system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated140 /&gt; One by one, Southern penitentiary systems had disintegrated during the [[American Civil War]]. [[Mississippi]] sent its prisoners to [[Alabama]] for safekeeping in the midst of a Northern invasion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated140 /&gt; [[Louisiana]] concentrated its prisoners into a single urban workhouse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated140 /&gt; [[Arkansas]] dispersed its convicts in 1863 when the [[Union Army]] breached its borders.&lt;ref name=autogenerated140 /&gt; Occupied [[Tennessee]] hired its prisoners out to the [[United States]] government, while [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] freed its inmates as General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] headed for [[Atlanta Campaign|Atlanta]] with his armies in 1864.&lt;ref name=autogenerated140 /&gt; With the fall of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], most of [[Virginia|Virginia's]] prisoners escaped.&lt;ref name=autogenerated140 /&gt;

The convict lease system emerged haltingly from this chaos, [[Edward L. Ayers]] and Marie Gottschalk conclude, just as the penitentiary itself had in years past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers, 185; Gottschalk, 47–52&quot;/&gt; The penitentiary had become a Southern institution at this point, [[Edward L. Ayers|Ayers]] points out, and its complete abolition would have required a major renovation of state criminal codes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated95&gt;Ayers, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states, like [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], tried to revive their penitentiary systems in the post-war years, but had to first deal with crumbling state infrastructure and a growing prison population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated95 /&gt; The three states that had not established prisons in the antebellum period—''i.e.'', the Carolinas and Florida—hastened to establish them during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 188–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

But many Southern states—including [[North Carolina]], [[Mississippi]], [[Virginia]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]—soon turned to the lease system as a temporary expedient, as rising costs and convict populations outstripped their meager resources.&lt;ref name=autogenerated37&gt;Ayers, 189; Gottschalk, 47–52.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Edward L. Ayers]], &quot;[t]he South . . . more or less stumbled into the lease, seeking a way to avoid large expenditures while hoping a truly satisfactory plan would emerge.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated37 /&gt; Social historian Marie Gottschalk characterizes these leasing arrangements as an &quot;important bridge between an agricultural economy based on slavery and the industrialization and agricultural modernization of the New South.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gottschalk, 49&quot;/&gt; This may help to explain why support for the convict lease was altogether widespread in Southern society, [[Edward L. Ayers|Ayers]] concludes. No single group—black or white, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]—consistently opposed the lease once it gained power.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The labor that convict lessees performed varied as the Southern economy evolved after the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-plantation owners were early beneficiaries, but emerging industrial capitalism ventures—''e.g.'', [[phosphate]] mines and [[turpentine]] plants in [[Florida]], railroads in [[Mississippi]] (and across the South)—soon came to demand convict labor.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 192–93&lt;/ref&gt; The South experienced an acute labor shortage in the post-war years, [[Edward L. Ayers]] explains, and no pool of displaced agricultural laborers was available to feed the needs of factory owners, as they had been in England and on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lease system was useful for capitalists who wanted to make money quickly: Labor costs were fixed and low, and labor uncertainty was reduced to the vanishing point.&lt;ref name=autogenerated76&gt;Ayers, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Convicts could be and were driven to a point free laborers would not tolerate (and could not drink or misbehave).&lt;ref name=autogenerated76 /&gt; Although labor unrest and economic depression continued to rile the North and its factories, the lease system insulated its beneficiaries in South from these external costs.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, [[Edward L. Ayers]] writes, the businessmen who utilized the convict-lease system were the same politicians who administered it. The system became, [[Edward L. Ayers|Ayers]] argues, a sort of &quot;mutual aid society&quot; for the new breed of capitalists and politicians who controlled the white Democratic regimes of the [[New South]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Edward L. Ayers|Ayers]] concludes, officials often had something to hide, and contemporary reports on leasing operations often skirted or ignored the appalling conditions and death rates that attended these projects.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alabama, 40 percent of convict lessees died during their term of labor in 1870—death rates for 1868 and 1869 were 18 and 17 percent, respectively.&lt;ref name=autogenerated66&gt;Ayers, 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Lessees on Mississippi's convict labor projects died at nine times the rate of inmates in Northern prisons throughout the 1880s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated66 /&gt; One man who had served time in the Mississippi system claimed that reported death rates would have been far higher had the state not pardoned many broken convicts before they died, so that they could do so at home instead.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Ayers, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to contemporary non-leasing prison systems nationwide, which recouped only 32 percent of expenses on average, convict leasing systems earned average profits of 267 percent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated101&gt;Ayers, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in comparison to Northern factories, [[Edward L. Ayers]] writes, the lease system's profitability was real and sustained in the post-war years and remained so into the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated101 /&gt;

Exposes on the lease system began appearing with increasing frequency in newspapers, state documents, Northern publications, and the publications of national prison associations during the post-war period—just as they did for Northern prisons like those in [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated101 /&gt; Mass grave sites containing the remains of convict lessees have been discovered in Southern states like [[Alabama]], where the [[United States Steel Corporation]] purchased convict labor for its mining operations for several years at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Blackmon, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of Southern justice on racial control in the post-war years had a profound effect on the demographics of the lease systems' populations. Before the Civil War, virtually all Southern prisoners were white, but under post-war leasing arrangements almost all (approximately 90 percent) were black.&lt;ref name=autogenerated101 /&gt; In the antebellum period, white immigrants made up a disproportionate share of the South's prison population before all but disappearing from prison records in the post-war period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated101 /&gt; The reasons for this are likely two-fold, [[Edward L. Ayers]] suggests. First, white immigrants generally avoided the post-war South due to its generally poor economic climate and the major increase in labor competition posed by emancipated slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 197–98&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the preoccupation of post-war Southern police forces with crime committed by blacks decreased their efforts among the white population, including immigrants.&lt;ref name=autogenerated134&gt;Ayers, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

The source of convicts also changed in the post-war South. Before the [[American Civil War]], rural counties sent few defendants to the state penitentiaries, but after the war rural courts became steady suppliers to their states' leasing systems (though cities remained the largest supplier of convict lessees during this period).&lt;ref name=autogenerated101 /&gt; [[Savannah, Georgia]], for example, sent convicts to leasing operations at approximately three times the number that its population would suggest, a pattern amplified by the reality that 76 percent of all blacks convicted in its courts received a prison sentence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated101 /&gt;

Most convicts were in their twenties or younger.&lt;ref name=autogenerated32&gt;Ayers, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of women in Southern prison systems, increased in the post-war years to about 7 percent, a ratio not incommensurate with other contemporary prisons in the United States, but a major increase for the South, which had previously boasted of the moral rectitude of its (white) female population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16&gt;Ayers, 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all such women were black.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt;

The officials who ran the South's leasing operations tried to maintain strict racial separation in the convict camps, refusing to recognize social equality between the races even among felons.&lt;ref name=autogenerated134 /&gt; As one Southerner reported to the National Prison Congress in 1886: Mixing the races in prison &quot;is akin to the torture anciently practised of tieing [''sic''] a murderer to the dead body of his victim limb to limb, from head to foot, until the decaying corpse brought death to the living.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Ayers, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Whites who did end up in Southern prisons, according to [[Edward L. Ayers]], were considered the lowest of their race. At least some legislators referred to white prisoners with the same [[racial epithets]] reserved for blacks at the time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated134 /&gt;

The Southern lease system was something less than a &quot;total system.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated66 /&gt; The vast majority of convict-lease camps were dispersed, with little in the way of walls or other securities measures&lt;ref name=autogenerated141&gt;Ayers, 203.&lt;/ref&gt;—although some Southern chain gangs were carted around in open-air cages to their work sites and kept in them at night.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 181; ''see also generally'' Blackmon.&lt;/ref&gt; Order in the camps was generally tenuous at best, [[Edward L. Ayers]] argues. Escapes were frequent and the brutal punishments that characterized the camps—chains, bloodhounds, guns, and corporal punishments—were dealt with a palpable sense of desperation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated66 /&gt; (At least some observers, however, questioned whether the high number of reported escapees was not a ploy to cover up foul play.)&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 201; Christianson, 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting changing criminal dockets in the Southern courts, about half of prisoners in the lease system served sentences for property crime.&lt;ref name=autogenerated141 /&gt; Rehabilitation played no real role in the system. Whatever onus for reform there was fell on the shoulders of chaplains, [[Edward L. Ayers]] relates.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 207.&lt;/ref&gt; As Warden J.H. Bankhead of the [[Alabama]] penitentiary observed in the 1870s: &quot;[O]ur system is a better training school for criminals than any of the dens of iniquity that exist in our large cities. . . . You may as well expect to instill decent habits into a hog as to reform a criminal whose habits and surroundings are as filthy as a pig's.&quot; &lt;ref name=autogenerated23 /&gt;

Some proponents of the lease claimed that the system would teach blacks to work, but many contemporary observers came to recognize—as historian [[C. Vann Woodward]] later would—that the system dealt a great blow to whatever moral authority white society had retained in its paternalistic approach to the &quot;race problem.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 208–09&lt;/ref&gt; Time in the penitentiary came to carry little stigma in the black community, as preachers and other community leaders spread word of its cruelty.&lt;ref name=autogenerated77&gt;Ayers, 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whites presented far from a united front in defense of the lease system during the [[Reconstruction Era]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated77 /&gt; Reformers and government insiders began condemning the worst abuses of the system from early on. Newspapers began taking up the call by the 1880s, although they had defended it during the more politically charged years that immediately followed the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 218.&lt;/ref&gt; But the system also had its defenders—at times even the reformers themselves, who chafed at Northern criticism even where they agreed with its substance.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The&quot;scientific&quot; racial attitudes of the late nineteenth century also helped some supporters of the lease to assuage their misgivings. One commentator wrote that blacks died in such numbers on the convict lease farms because of the weakness of their inferior, &quot;uneducated&quot; blood.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic, rather than moral, concerns underlay the more successful attacks on leasing. Labor launched effective opposition movements to the lease in the post-war period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated77 /&gt; [[Birmingham, Alabama]], and its Anti-Convict League, formed in 1885, were the center of this movement, according to [[Edward L. Ayers|Ayers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Coal miner revolts against the lease occurred twenty-two recorded times in the South between 1881 and 1900.&lt;ref name=autogenerated63&gt;Ayers, 216.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1895, [[Tennessee]] caved in to the demands of its miners and abolished its lease system.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 215.&lt;/ref&gt; These revolts notably crossed racial lines. In [[Alabama]], for instance, white and black free miners marched side-by-side to protest the use of convict labor in local mining operations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated63 /&gt;

In these confrontations, convict labor surely took on a somewhat exaggerated importance to free workers, argues [[Edward L. Ayers]]. Only 27,000 convicts were engaged in some form of labor arrangement in the 1890s South.&lt;ref name=autogenerated139&gt;Ayers, 213.&lt;/ref&gt; But the emerging nature of Southern industry and labor groups—which tended to be smaller and more concentrated—made for a situation in which a small number of convicts could affect entire industries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated139 /&gt;

===Progressive era===

====Southern developments====

=====Gradual demise of the convict lease=====
Just as the convict lease emerged gradually in the post-war South, it also made a gradual exit.

Although [[Virginia]], [[Texas]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Missouri]] utilized Northern-style manufacturing prisons in addition to their farms, as late as 1890 the majority of Southern convicts still passed their sentences in convict camps run by absentee businessmen.&lt;ref name=autogenerated113&gt;Ayers, 221.&lt;/ref&gt; But the 1890s also marked the beginning of a gradual shift toward compromise over the lease system, in the form of state-run prison farms.&lt;ref name=autogenerated113 /&gt; States began to cull the women, children, and the sick from the old privately run camps during this period, to remove them from the &quot;contamination&quot; of bad criminals and provide a healthier setting and labor regime.&lt;ref name=autogenerated113 /&gt; [[Mississippi]] enacted a new state constitution in 1890 that called for the end of the lease by 1894.&lt;ref name=autogenerated113 /&gt;

Despite these changes, and continuing attacks from labor movements, [[Populism|Populists]], and [[Greenback Party|Greenbackers]], only two Southern states besides [[Mississippi]] ended the system prior to the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated113 /&gt; Most Southern states did bring their systems under tighter control and make increasing use of state penal farms by the twentieth century, however, resulting in improved conditions and a decline in death rates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated133&gt;Ayers, 222.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] abolished its system in 1908, after an expose by [[Charles Edward Russell]] in ''[[Everybody's Magazine]]'' revealed &quot;hideous&quot; conditions on lease projects.&lt;ref name=autogenerated89 /&gt; A former warden described how men in the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] camps were hung by their thumbs as punishment, to the point that their thumbs became so stretched and deformed, to the length of index fingers, that they resembled the &quot;paws of certain apes.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated89 /&gt; Florida's prison camps—where even the sick were forced to work under threat of a beating or shooting—remained in use until 1923.&lt;ref name=autogenerated89 /&gt;

Replacements for the lease system, such as [[chain gang]]s and state prison farms, were not so different from their predecessors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated133 /&gt; An example of the lingering influence of the lease system can be found in the Arkansas prison farms. By the mid-twentieth century, Arkansas' male penal system still consisted of two large prison farms, which remained almost totally cut off from the outside world and continued to operate much as they had during the [[Reconstruction Era]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated67&gt;Christianson, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions in these camps were bad enough that, as late as the 1960s, an [[Oregon]] judge refused to return escapees from [[Arkansas]], who had been apprehended in his jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 262.&lt;/ref&gt; The judge declared that returning the prisoners to [[Arkansas]] would make his state complicit in what he described as &quot;institutes of terror, horror, and despicable evil,&quot; which he compared to [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, around the time of the [[Oregon]] judge's ruling, the ratio of staff to inmates at the Arkansas penal farms was one staff member for every sixty-five inmates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated67 /&gt; By contrast, the national average at the time was around one prison staff member for every seven inmates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated67 /&gt; The state was not the only entity profiting from the farm; private operators controlled certain of its industries and maintained high profit margins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christianson, 261&quot;&gt;Christianson, 261.&lt;/ref&gt; The physician who ran the farm's for-profit blood bank, for instance, earned between $130,000 and $150,000 per year off of inmate donations that he sold to hospitals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christianson, 261&quot;/&gt;

Faced with this acute shortage of manpower, authorities at the penal farms relied upon armed inmates, known as &quot;trusties&quot; or &quot;riders,&quot; to guard the convicts while they worked&lt;ref name=autogenerated67 /&gt; Under the trusties' control prisoners worked ten to fourteen hours per day (depending on the time of year), six days per week.&lt;ref name=autogenerated67 /&gt; Arkansas was, at the time, the only state where prison officials could still whip convicts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated67 /&gt;

Violent deaths were commonplace on the Arkansas prison farms.&lt;ref name=autogenerated81&gt;Christianson, 259.&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation begun by incumbent Governor [[Orval Faubus]] during a heated 1966 gubernatorial race revealed ongoing abuses—''e.g.'', use of wire pliers on inmates' genitals, stabbings, use of nut crackers to break inmates knuckles, trampling of inmates with horses, and charging inmates for hospital time after beatings.&lt;ref name=autogenerated81 /&gt; When the chairman of the Arkansas legislature's prison committee was asked about the allegations, however, he replied, &quot;Arkansas has the best prison system in the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Christianson, 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Only later, after a federal court intervened, did reforms begin at the Arkansas prison camps.&lt;ref&gt;Christianson, 260–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{slavery}}

The institution of [[slavery]] in North America earliest years of the colonial period up until 1863, when President [[Abraham Lincoln]] freed slaves in the rebellious southern states through the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], taking effect in December 1865, permanently abolished slavery throughout the entire United States, including the [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border States]], such as [[History of slavery in Kentucky|Kentucky]], which still had about 50,000 slaves. It was also abolished among the sovereign [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribes]] in [[Indian Territory]] by new peace treaties which the US required after the war.

For most of the seventeenth and part of the eighteenth centuries, male slaves outnumbered female slaves, making the two groups' experiences in the colonies distinct. Living and working in a wide range of circumstances and regions, African-American women and men encountered diverse experiences of enslavement. With increasing numbers of imported African women, as well as those born into slavery in the colonies, slave sex ratios leveled out between 1730 and 1750. &quot;The uniqueness of the African-American female's situation is that she stands at the crossroads of two of the most well-developed ideologies in America, that regarding women and that regarding the Negro.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Deborah Gray|title=Ar’n't I a Woman (''sic'')|year=1999|location=New York City|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living both female and black identities, enslaved African women faced both racism and sexism.

===Virginia===
{{main|History of slavery in Virginia}}
[[File:SlaveDanceand Music.jpg|thumbnail|right|Slaves on a Virginia plantation (The Old Plantation, c. 1790).]]
From 1700 to 1740 an estimated number of 43,000 slaves were imported into Virginia, and almost all but 4,000 were imported directly from Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saxton p. 121&quot;&gt;Saxton, Martha, Being Good: Women's Moral Values in Early America, New York City, 2003, 121&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship suggests that the number of women and men imported in this period was more or less equal and included a high number of children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saxton p. 121&quot; /&gt; As most were from West Africa, its cultures were central in mid- to late- eighteenth-century slave life in Virginia.  African values were prevalent and West African women's cultures had strong representations. Some prevalent cultural representations were the deep and powerful bonds between mother and child, and among women within the larger female community.&lt;ref&gt;Saxton, Martha, ''Being Good: Women's Moral Values in Early America,'' New York City, 2003, 122-123&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] ethnic group in particular (from present-day [[Nigeria]]), which comprised between one-third and one-half of incoming slaves in the early eighteenth century, female authority (the omu) &quot;ruled on a wide variety of issues of important to women in particular and the community as a whole.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Saxton (2003), ''Being Good'', p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  The Igbo represented one group of people brought to the Chesapeake, but in general, Africans came from an extremely diverse range of cultural backgrounds. All came from worlds where women's communities were strong,&lt;ref&gt;Saxton (2003), ''Being Good'', p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;  and were introduced into a patriarchal and violently racist and exploitative society; white men typically characterized all black women as passionately sexual, to justify their sexual abuse and miscegenation.&lt;ref&gt;Saxton (2003), ''Being Good'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia girls, much less black girls, were not educated, and most were illiterate. African and African American female slaves occupied a broad range of positions. The southern colonies were majorly agrarian societies and enslaved women provided labor in the fields, planting and doing chores, but mostly in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], nursing, taking care of children, cooking, laundering, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rutagarama|first=Naomi|title=Female Slavery In The South|url=http://prezi.com/v46ikdnnanma/female-slavery-in-the-south/|publisher=Prezi|accessdate=12/09/13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New England ===
[[File:Jersey Negro (1748), John Greenwood.jpg|thumbnail|left|Jersey Negro (1748), [[John Greenwood (artist)|John Greenwood]]. This portrait of Ann Arnold was the first individual portrait of a black woman in North America. Ann Arnold was the wet nurse of a child whose parents were born in the English isle of [[Jersey]].  [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].]]
Historian [[Ira Berlin]] distinguished between &quot;slave societies&quot; and &quot;societies with slaves.&quot; New England was considered to be a society with slaves, dependent on maritime trade and diversified agriculture, in contrast to the slave societies of the south, which were &quot;socially, economically, and politically dependent on slave labor, had a large enslaved population, and allowed masters extensive power over their slaves unchecked by the law.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams p. 29&quot;&gt;Catherine Adams and Elizabeth H. Pleck. &quot;The Uniqueness of New England,&quot; Love of Freedom, New York, City, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  New England had a small slave population and masters thought of themselves as patriarchs with the duty to protect, guide, and care for their slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams p. 29&quot; /&gt; Enslaved women in New England had greater opportunity to seek freedom than in other regions because of &quot;the New England legal system, the frequency of manumission by owners, and chances for hiring out, especially among enslaved men, who seized the opportunity to earn enough money to purchase a wife and children.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams p. 30&quot;&gt;Catherine Adams and Elizabeth H. Pleck. &quot;The Uniqueness of New England,&quot; Love of Freedom, New York, City, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enslaved women largely occupied traditional &quot;women's work&quot; roles and were often hired out by the day. They worked mainly as maids, in the kitchen, the barn, and the garden. They did menial and servile tasks: polished family silver or furniture, helped with clothes and hair, drew baths, barbered the men, and completed menial domestic chores like sweeping, emptying chamber pots, carrying gallons of water a day, washing the dishes, brewing, looking after young children and the elderly, cooking and baking, milking the cows, feeding the chickens, spinning, knitting, carding, sewing, and laundering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams p. 30&quot; /&gt;  Their daily work was less demanding than the field labor of enslaved women in other regions. Nonetheless enslaved women in New England worked hard, often under poor living conditions and malnutrition. &quot;As a result of heavy work, poor housing conditions, and inadequate diet, the average black woman did not live past forty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams p. 35&quot;&gt;Catherine Adams and Elizabeth H. Pleck. &quot;The Uniqueness of New England,&quot; Love of Freedom, New York, City, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enslaved women were given to white women as gifts from their husbands, and as wedding and Christmas gifts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams p. 35&quot; /&gt;  The idea that New England masters treated their slaves with greater kindness in comparison to southern slave-owners is a myth. They had little mobility freedom and lacked access to education and any training. &quot;The record of slaves who were branded by their owners, had their ears nailed, fled, committed suicide, suffered the dissolution of their families, or were sold secretly to new owners in Barbados in the last days of the Revolutionary War before they become worthless seems sufficient to refute the myth of kindly masters. They lashed out at their slaves when they were angry, filled with rage, or had convenient access to horsewhip.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams p. 36&quot;&gt;Catherine Adams and Elizabeth H. Pleck. &quot;The Uniqueness of New England,&quot; Love of Freedom, New York, City, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Female slaves were sometimes forced by their masters into sexual relationships with enslaved men for the purpose of [[Forced pregnancy|forced breeding]]. It was also not uncommon for enslaved women to be raped and in some cases impregnated by their masters.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Southern colonies ===
No matter where they lived, slaves endured hard and demeaning lives, but labor in the southern colonies was most severe. The southern colonies were slave societies, &quot;socially, economically, and politically dependent on slave labor, had a large enslaved population, and allowed masters extensive power over their slaves unchecked by the law.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams p. 29&quot; /&gt;  Plantations were the economic power structure of the South, and male and female slave labor was its foundation. Early on, slaves in the South worked primarily in agriculture, on farms and plantations growing indigo, rice, and tobacco; cotton became a major crop after the 1790s. Female slaves worked in a wide variety of capacities. They were expected to do field work as well as have children, and in this way increase the slave population. In the years before the American Revolution, the female slave population grew mainly as a result of natural increase and not importation. &quot;Once slaveholders realized that the reproductive function of the female slave could yield a profit, the manipulation of procreative sexual relations became an integral part of the sexual exploitation of female slaves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;White, Deborah Gray. ''Ar’n't I a Woman, New York City,'' 1999, 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many slave women raised their children without much assistance from males. Enslaved women were counted on not only to do their house and field work, but also to bear, nourish, and rear the children whom slaveholders sought to continually replenish their labor force.  As houseslaves, women were domestic servants: cooking, sewing, acting as maids, and rearing the planter's children. Later on they were used in many factories, instrumental in the development of the United States, where they were kept at lower maintenance costs, .{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Revolutionary Era==
{{main|African Americans in the Revolutionary War}}

During the [[Revolutionary War]] (1775–83) enslaved women served on both sides, the Loyalist army as well as the Patriots', as nurses, laundresses, and cooks. But as historian Carol Berkin writes, &quot;African American loyalties were to their own future, not to Congress or to king.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, &quot;African American Women and the American Revolution,&quot; ''Revolutionary Mothers,'' New York, 2005, 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  Enslaved women could be found in army camps and as [[camp followers]]. They worked building roads, constructing fortifications, and laundering uniforms, &quot;but they remained slaves rather than refugees. Masters usually hired these women out to the military, sometimes hiring out their children as well.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berkin p. 131&quot;&gt;Carol Berkin, &quot;African American Women and the American Revolution,&quot; ''Revolutionary Mothers,'' New York, 2005, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  Enslaved women could also be found working in the shops, homes, fields, and plantations of every American colony. It is estimated that by 1770, there were more than 47,000 enslaved blacks in the northern colonies, almost 20,000 of them in New York. More than 320,000 slaves worked in the Chesapeake colonies, making 37 percent of the population of the region African or African American. Over 187,000 of these slaves were in Virginia. In the Lower South there were more than 92,000 slaves. South Carolina alone had over 75,000 slaves, and by 1770 planters there were importing 4,000 Africans a year. In many counties in the Lower South, the slave population outnumbered the white.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, &quot;African American Women and the American Revolution,&quot; ''Revolutionary Mothers,'' New York, 2005, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although service in the military did not guarantee enslaved people their freedom, black men had the opportunity to escape slavery by enlisting in the army. During the disruption of war, both men and women ran away. Men were more likely to escape, as pregnant women, mothers, and women who nursed their elderly parents or friends seldom abandoned those who depended on them.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, &quot;African American Women and the American Revolution,&quot; Revolutionary Mothers, New York, 2005, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;  So many slaves deserted their plantations in South Carolina, that there were not enough field hands to plant or harvest crops. As food grew scarce, the blacks who remained behind suffered from starvation or enemy attack. The British issued certificates of manumission to more than 914 women as reward for serving in the Loyalist army.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, &quot;African American Women and the American Revolution,&quot; Revolutionary Mothers, New York, 2005, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  But many women who had won their freedom lost it again &quot;through violence and trickery and the venality of men entrusted with their care.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, &quot;African American Women and the American Revolution,&quot; Revolutionary Mothers, New York, 2005, 134.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others who managed to secure their freedom faced racial prejudice, discrimination, and poverty. When loyalist plantations were captured, enslaved women were often taken and sold for the soldiers' profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berkin p. 131&quot; /&gt; The British did keep promises to black slaves, evacuating them along with troops in the closing days of the war, and resettling more than 3,000 [[Black Loyalists]] in [[Nova Scotia]], and others in the Caribbean, and England. In 1792 it established [[Freetown]], in what is now [[Sierra Leone]], as a colony for Poor Blacks from London, as well as Black Loyalists from Canada who wanted to relocate.

One of the most well-known voices for freedom around the Revolutionary era was [[Phillis Wheatley]] of Massachusetts. She was a slave for most of her life but was given freedom by her master. Educated in Latin, Greek, and English, Wheatley wrote a collection of poems which asserted that Africans, as children of God just like Europeans, deserved respect and freedom.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 1777, Vermont drafted a state constitution that prohibited the institution of slavery. In 1780 Massachusetts a state judge declared slavery to be unconstitutional according to the state's new bill of rights, which declared &quot;all men...free and equal.&quot; Slavery effectively ended in Massachusetts with this ruling in a [[freedom suit]] by [[Quock Walker]]. This led to an increase of enslaved men and women suing for their freedom in New England. Also in 1780 in Pennsylvania, the legislature enacted &quot;a gradual emancipation law that directly connected the ideals of the Revolution with the rights of the African Americans to freedom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, &quot;African American Women and the American Revolution,&quot; ''Revolutionary Mothers,'' New York, 2005, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the South, the immediate legacy of the Revolution was increased [[manumission]] by slaveholders in the first two decades after the war. But, the invention of the [[cotton gin]] enabled widespread cultivation of short-staple cotton, and with the opening up of southwestern lands to cotton and sugar production, demand for slaves increased. Legislatures made emancipation difficult to gain, and they passed harsher laws regulating African-American lives.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Berkin, &quot;African American Women and the American Revolution,&quot; ''Revolutionary Mothers,'' New York, 2005, 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antebellum Period==
[[File:Crowe-Slaves Waiting for Sale - Richmond, Virginia.jpg|thumbnail|left|&quot;Slaves Waiting for Sale.&quot; Women and children slaves wait to be sold in Richmond, Virginia in the 19th century. Painted upon the sketch of 1853.]]
As historian Deborah Gray White explains, &quot;Black in a white society, slave in a free society, woman in a society ruled by men, female slaves had the least formal power and were perhaps the most vulnerable group of Americans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;White, Deborah Gray. ''Ar’n't I a Woman, New York City,'' 1999, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mother-daughter relationship was often the most enduring and cherished within the African-American complex of relations.&lt;ref&gt;White, Deborah Gray. ''Ar’n't I a Woman'', New York City, 1999, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relatively few women were runaways, and when they did run, they sometimes escaped with their children.  Historian [[Martha Saxton]] writes about enslaved mothers' experiences in St. Louis in the antebellum period: &quot;In Marion County, north of St. Louis, a slave trader bought three small children from an owner, but the children's mother killed them all and herself rather than let them be taken away. A St. Louis trader took a crying baby from its mother, both on their way to be sold, and made a gift of it to a white woman standing nearby because its noise was bothering him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Saxton p. 185&quot;&gt;Saxton (2003), ''Being Good'', p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Little girls as young as seven were frequently sold away from their mothers: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Mary Bell was hired out by the year to take care of three children starting when she was seven. John Mullanphy noted that he had living with him a four-year-old mulatto girl, whom he willed to the Sisters of Charity in the event of his death. George Morton sold his daughter Ellen 'a certain Mulatto girl a slave about fourteen years of age named Sally, being the child of a certain Negro woman named Ann'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Saxton p. 185&quot;/&gt; In 1854 Georgia was the first and only state to pass a law that put conditions of sales that separated mothers and their children. Children under five could not be sold away from their mothers, &quot;unless such division cannot in any wise be [e]ffected without such separation.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Saxton p. 185&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Ellen Craft escaped slave.jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|In 1848 [[Ellen Craft]], of mixed-race, posed as a white man to escape from slavery.]]
Slave girls in North America often worked within the domestic sphere, providing household help. White families sought the help of a &quot;girl&quot;, an &quot;all-purpose tool&quot; in family life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saxton p. 186&quot;&gt;Saxton, Martha, Being Good: Women's Moral Values in Early America, New York City, 2003, 186&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the word &quot;girl&quot; applied to any working female without children, slaves were preferred because in the long run they cost less. These enslaved girls were usually very young, anywhere from nine years of age to their mid-teens. Heavy household work was assigned to the &quot;girl&quot; and was therefore stigmatized as &quot;negroes’&quot; work. A &quot;girl&quot; was an essential source of help to white families, rural and urban, middle class and aspiring. She provided freedom for daughters to devote themselves to their self-development and relieved mothers from exhausting labor, while requiring no financial or emotional maintenance, &quot;no empathy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Saxton p. 186&quot; /&gt;

In antebellum America, as in the past (from the initial African-European contact in North America), black women were deemed to be governed by their libidos and portrayed as &quot;Jezebel character[s]...in every way the counterimage of the mid-nineteenth-century ideal of the Victorian lady.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;White, Deborah Gray. ''Ar’n't I a Woman,'' New York City, 1999, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enslaved women in every state of the antebellum union considered freedom, but it was a livelier hope in the North than in most of the South. Many slaves sought their freedom through self-purchase, the legal system of [[freedom suits]], and as runaways, sometimes resulting in the separation of children and parents. &quot;Unfinished childhoods and brutal separations punctuated the lives of most African American girls, and mothers dreamed of freedom that would not impose more losses on their daughters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Saxton, Martha, ''Being Good: Women's Moral Values in Early America,'' New York City, 2003, 183&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antebellum South===
[[File:Eastman Johnson - Negro Life at the South - ejb - fig 67 - pg 120.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Eastman Johnson]]'s 1859 painting &quot;[[Negro Life at the South]]&quot; subtly portrays relationships of white male masters and their female slaves.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cotton Cultivation, U.S. South, 1875.jpg|thumbnail|Field gang on men and women working on a plantation &quot;covering the seed.&quot; Cotton Cultivation, U.S. South, 1875; Image Reference cottonculture-1875, as shown on www.slaveryimages.org, compiled by Jerome Handler and Michael Tuite, and sponsored by the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities and the University of Virginia Library.]] --&gt;
After the Revolution, Southern plantation owners imported a massive number of new slaves from Africa and the Caribbean until the banning of the trade in 1808. More importantly, more than one million slaves were transported in a forced migration in the domestic slave trade, from the Upper South to the Deep South, most by slave traders—either overland where they were held for days in chained coffles, or by the [[coastwise trade]] and ships. The majority of slaves in the Deep South, men and women, worked on cotton plantations. Cotton was the leading cash crop during this time, but slaves also worked on rice, corn, sugarcane, and tobacco plantations, clearing new land, digging ditches, cutting and hauling wood, slaughtering livestock, and making repairs to buildings and tools. Black women also cared for their children and managed the bulk of the housework and domestic chores. Living with the dual burdens of racism and sexism, enslaved women in the South held roles within the family and community that contrasted sharply with more traditional or upper class American women's roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Debra|title=Ar'n't I a Woman ''(sic)''|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/arnt-i-a-woman-deborah-gray-white/1111826123?ean=9780393343526|accessdate=12/09/13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young girls generally started working well before boys, with many working before age seven.&lt;ref&gt;Steckel, Richard, &quot;Women, Work, and Health Under Plantation Slavery in the United States,&quot; ''More than Chattel''. Indiana University Press, 1996, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although field work was traditionally considered to be &quot;men's work,&quot; different estimates conclude that between 63-80 percent of women worked in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;Steckel, Richard, &quot;Women, Work, and Health Under Plantation Slavery in the United States,&quot; ''More than Chattel''. Indiana University Press, 1996, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adult female work depended greatly upon plantation size. On small farms, women and men performed similar tasks, while on larger plantations, males were given more physically demanding work. Few of the chores performed by enslaved women took them off the plantation. Therefore they were less mobile than enslaved men, who often assisted their masters in the transportation of crops, supplies, and other materials, and were often hired out as artisans and craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;White, Deborah Gray. [[Ar’n't I a Woman]], New York City, 1999, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;  Women also worked in the domestic sphere as servants, cooks, seamstresses, and nurses. Although a female slave's labor in the field superseded childrearing in importance, the responsibilities of childbearing and childcare greatly circumscribed the life of an enslaved woman. This also explains why female slaves were less likely to run away than men.&lt;ref&gt;White, Deborah Gray. [[Ar’n't I a Woman]], New York City, 1999, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many female slaves were the object of severe [[Sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]]; often bearing the children of their white masters, master's sons, or overseers. Black women were prohibited from defending themselves against any type of abuse, including sexual, at the hands of white men. If a slave attempted to defend herself, she was often subjected to further beatings from the master or even the mistress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/05intersection/Gender/rape.htm |title=The Realities of Enslaved Female Africans in America |publisher=Academic.udayton.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black female, Woman or child, was forced into sexual relationships for the white slave master’s pleasure and profit; attempting to keep the slave population growing by his own doing, and not by importing more slaves from Africa. Even Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States, is believed to have fathered six mixed-race children (four survived to adulthood) with one of his female slaves, [[Sally Hemings]], a woman of three-quarters European ancestry and half-sister to his late wife, who served as the widower's [[concubine]] for more than two decades. In the case of [[Harriet Ann Jacobs]], author of ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]],'' her master, Dr. James Norcom, had sexually harassed her for years. Even after she had two children of her own, he threatened to sell them if she denied his sexual advances.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Emancipation and the ending of slavery==
{{main|Emancipation Proclamation}}

Slavery was abolished in the United States in 1865, with the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]]. The decree offered enslaved men a path to freedom through military service. However it wasn't until the Act of 1861 where women found their freedom as they were no longer declared property of the Confederates in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Du Bois's Black Reconstruction and Slave Women's War for Freedom|last = Glymph|first = Thavolia|date = Summer 2013|journal = South Atlantic Quarterly|doi = 10.1215/00382876-2146431|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] extended citizenship rights to African Americans.{{cite web | url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/powers13th14th15th.htm | title= The Powers of Congress to Enforce the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments | publisher =University of Missouri - Kansas City, School of Law |date=April 27, 2013}}

* [[Lucy Terry]] (c. 1730–1821) is the author of the oldest known work of literature by an African American.
* [[Phillis Wheatley]] (May 8, 1753 – December 5, 1784) was the first African-American poet and first African-American woman to publish a book.
* [[Margaret Garner]] (called Peggy) was an enslaved African American woman in pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] United States who was notorious—or celebrated—for killing her own daughter after being captured following her escape, rather than allowing the child to be returned to slavery.
* [[Sojourner Truth]] (c. 1797 – November 26, 1883) was the self-given name, from 1843 onward, of Isabella Baumfree, an African-American [[abolitionist]] and women's rights activist. Truth was born into slavery in Swartekill, [[Ulster County, New York]]. In 1826, she escaped with her infant daughter to freedom. After going to court to recover her son, she became the first black woman to win such a case against a white man. Her best-known extemporaneous speech on gender inequalities, &quot;[[Ain't I a Woman?]]&quot;, was delivered in 1851 at the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in [[Akron, Ohio]]. During the Civil War, Truth helped recruit black troops for the Union Army; after the war, she tried unsuccessfully to secure land grants from the federal government for former slaves.
* [[Harriet Tubman]] (born Araminta Harriet Ross; 1820 – March 10, 1913) was an African-American abolitionist, humanitarian, and Union spy during the American Civil War. Born into slavery, Tubman escaped and subsequently made more than thirteen missions to rescue more than 70 slaves; she guided refugees along the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the [[Underground Railroad]]. She later helped [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] recruit men for his [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raid on Harpers Ferry]], and in the post-war era struggled for women's suffrage.
* [[Ellen Craft]] (1826–1897) was a slave from [[Macon, Georgia]] who posed as a white male planter to escape from slavery. She escaped to the North on December 1848 by travelling openly by train and steamboat with her husband, who acted as her slave servant; they reached Philadelphia and freedom on Christmas Day.

'''Nenana Valley''' is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] site in the [[Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area]] of [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bulletin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYMeAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA290|accessdate=2 May 2013|year=1931|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bigelow1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy H. Bigelow|title=Analysis of Late Quaternary Soils and Sediments in the Nenana Valley, Central Alaska|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AGI3OAAACAAJ|accessdate=2 May 2013|year=1991|publisher=University of Alaska Fairbanks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was first occupied around eleven thousand years ago, circa 9,000 B.C.E, and likely represents one of the earliest sites in North America. The location of artifacts in the stratigraphic column suggests that, originally, the site was not occupied year-round, and that during the last glacial period people would have been travelling back and forth between North America and Russia, using this site as an outpost. Zooarchaeological evidence, such as mammoth and sheep bones, suggest that people were following these paths seasonally for hunting. As the ice age ended, the site would have become a more permanent residence. Points found here suggest that the culture is ancestral to that which created the Clovis points, of which variations can be found across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powers|first1=William|last2=John|first2=Hoffecker|title=Late Pleistocene Settlement in the Nenana Valley, Central Alaska|journal=American Antiquity|date=April 1989|volume=54|issue=2|pages=263–87|doi=10.2307/281707|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/281707?origin=api|accessdate=7 November 2014|publisher=Society for American Archeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

a{{note|BlackPop}} These population estimates include a small number of Native Americans/[[Amerindians|Indians]] as part of the Black/Negro population throughout this time period (1610–1780).&lt;ref name=&quot;census5&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- The source indicates that a few numbers for &quot;Negro&quot; population (not &quot;Black&quot;) for a minority of the colonies included some &quot;Indians&quot; (not Native Americans). Further, it indicates that some &quot;Indians&quot; were counted as such, again in a minority of the colonies. A further wrinkle that ought to be noted is that mulattoes were sometimes enumerated separately in colonial censuses, sometimes included with Negroes, and sometimes not mentioned (so researchers can't tell how they were classified.) --&gt;&lt;br&gt;
b{{note|NatAmPop}} While all Native Americans in the United States were only counted as part of the (total) U.S. population since 1890, the U.S. Census Bureau previously either enumerated or made estimates of the non-taxed Native American population (which was not counted as a part of the U.S. population before 1890) for the 1860–1880 time period. The combined taxed and non-taxed Native American population in the United States was 339,421 in [[United States Census, 1860|1860]], 313,712 in [[United States Census, 1870|1870]], and 306,543 in [[United States Census, 1880|1880]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2006/summer/indian-census.html |title=Native Americans in the Census, 1860–1890 |publisher=Archives.gov |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
c{{note|Multiracial}} Data on race from the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Censuses are not directly comparable with those from the 1990 census and previous censuses due, in large part, to giving respondents the option to report more than one race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/census2000/raceqandas.html |title=Questions and Answers for Census 2000 Data on Race |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black population as a percentage of the total population by U.S. region and state (1790–2010)==
Many Southern U.S. states historically had African Americans compose 35% or more of their total population(s), with three of them (Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina) even having an African American majority at certain periods in their history. In contrast, the African American percentage of the total population in other parts of the U.S. (outside of the South) was historically almost always in the single digits (0.0% to 9.9%). Even after the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], no or almost no U.S. state outside of the Southern U.S. has ever had an African American percentage of its total population be greater than 16%.

==Mexican (1910–1930) and Hispanic/Latino (1940–2010) population as a percentage of the total population by U.S. region and state==
Historically, the U.S. states with the largest Mexican/Hispanic/Latino populations were primarily located in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern states]], [[Texas]] and [[Florida]].

The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] has projected that the U.S. [[Non-Hispanic whites|white non-Hispanic]] population will become a minority (that is, less than half of the total U.S. population) during the 2040s, resulting in a plurality.&lt;ref name=CensusMidcentury2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/population/cb08-123.html |title=An Older and More Diverse Nation by Midcentury |date=August 14, 2008 |number=Release CB08-123 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, the U.S. Census Bureau projected that 2043 would be the year in which the U.S. would become a [[majority minority]] nation, with no single ethnic classification constituting a majority of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;CensusCB12-243&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/population/cb12-243.html |title=U.S. Census Bureau Projections Show a Slower Growing, Older, More Diverse Nation a Half Century from Now |date=December 12, 2012 |number=Release CB12-243 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2060, Hispanic Americans are projected to account for about one-third of the total U.S. population.&lt;ref name=&quot;CensusCB12-243&quot;/&gt; The tables present Census Bureau &quot;middle series&quot; projections published in May 2013.

====White (non-Hispanic)====
The natural increase is slightly smaller than shown for non-Hispanic whites and slightly different for non-Hispanic blacks because the birth figures shown refer to mothers of that race, not the children. Most non-white babies of non-Hispanic white mothers are either Hispanic or black, and non-Hispanic black mothers occasionally have Hispanic children. On the other hand, all children born to Hispanic mothers, even if the mothers are white Hispanic, are counted as Hispanic.&lt;br&gt;

=== Hispanics (of all racial groups) ===
*Notes: Estimates for the population of each race by year (available starting in 2000) do not include multiracial individuals which have been &quot;bridged&quot; to the single-race categories for the purposes of calculating the birth and fertility rates.
New Hampshire did not start reporting Hispanic origin until 1993, and Oklahoma until 1991, so data from those states are excluded before then.&lt;br&gt;

–The '''Plantations of New England''' were a series of colonisation efforts by [[Europe]]ans on the east coast of [[North America]], a land that they called [[New England]].

[[Image:Map-Novi Belgii Novæque Angliæ (Amsterdam, 1685).jpg|275px|thumb|right|A seventeenth century map shows New England as a costal enclave extending from [[Cape Cod]] to ''[[New France]]'' while its interior is rendered ''[[New Netherland|New Belgium]]'', ''[[New Netherland]]'' and ''[[Irocoisia]]'']]
The name New England dates to the earliest days of European settlement: in 1616 [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]] described the area in a pamphlet &quot;New England.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=John |title=A Description of New England|year=1616|publisher=Humfrey Lownes, for Robert Clerk|location=the Lodge, in Chancery lane|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=etas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name was officially sanctioned in 1620 by the grant of [[James I of England|King James I]] to the [[Plymouth Council for New England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Pilgrim Hall Museum|title=The Plymouth Colony Patent: The Finale|url=http://www.pilgrimhall.org/PatentFinale.htm|work=The Plymouth Colony Patent|accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The region was subsequently divided through further grants, including the 1629 royal grant of &quot;[[Province of New Hampshire|Hampshire]]&quot; which was issued for ''&quot;making a Plantation &amp; establishing of a Colony or Colonyes in the Countrey called or knowen by ye name of New England in America.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Yale Law School|title=Grant of Hampshire to Capt.

The role plantations played in New England’s economy in the past was not as significant as the role agriculture played in Southern colonies.

==History of Agriculture in New England==

===Native American Land Use===

Agricultural activity existed in New England before European settlers arrived in the region. By the time colonizers arrived, “Native American agriculture in southern New England had developed into a well-ordered system”.&lt;ref name=&quot;agr&quot;&gt;Agriculture in New England. George Christie. Historic New England. &lt;http://www.historicnewengland.org/school-youth-programs/k-12-programs-resources/pdfs/ne_agriculture.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the civilian diet came from corn (maize), which was planted “in hills in clearings the Native cut in the woods”. Relative to the role played by the agricultural sector in southern New England, agriculture was less well developed in northern New England due to the shorter growing season. As such, the majority of the diet in the north came from hunting, fishing, and “gathering wild berries and nuts”.&lt;ref name=&quot;agr&quot;/&gt; Plantations in southern New England also included farming of beans, squash, and pumpkins, which were planted with the corn. Additionally, though the tobacco industry thrived to a much greater extent in Southern colonies, tobacco was also grown to a relatively lesser extent in New England. Other crops included melons and strawberries.&lt;ref name=&quot;agr&quot;/&gt;

By the time the colonizers settled, the agricultural system was cyclical in that fields were cleared of trees, then used for five or more years after which they naturally reverted to woodland as a consequence of how quickly forests regeneration in the New England area. With respect to relative male to female involvement in plantations, though farm work was mostly conducted by the women, men were more involved in tobacco cultivation.&lt;ref name=&quot;agr&quot;/&gt;

===Colonial Land Use===

Though agricultural activity existed in New England before early colonial settlers arrived, land was barely touched relative to the massive plantation scales seen in England at the time. As such, early settlers were greeted with great opportunities to utilize the kinds of land use improvements previously implemented in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;agr&quot;/&gt; Up until the colonial time period, there was a significant amount of unused land that was characterized by undeveloped wilderness. The primary improvement that settlers brought about was thus the recreation of the English farming system that efficiently utilized the vast areas of untamed wilderness.&lt;ref name=&quot;agr&quot;/&gt; However, relative to the massive for-profit cash-crop plantations in the South, plantations in New England were small-scale, and meant mainly for subsistence purposes rather than profit making.&lt;ref name=&quot;agr2&quot;&gt;The Agricultural Revolution in New England. Percy W. Bidwell. The American Historical Review, Vol. 26, No. 4 (J ul., 1921), 683-702. &lt;http://people.brandeis.edu/~dkew/David/Bidwell-agriculture-1921.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the improvements came a complication: the English methods of the time were unsustainable in the New England region, such that much of the land was worn out by the early 1800. This paved the way for another improvement in the agricultural system, namely the use of applied science to make crop production more efficient and sustainable.&lt;ref name=&quot;agr&quot;/&gt;

==Industrialization &amp; Agriculture==

The half-century period before the Civil War, more generally between 1800 and 1900, saw the “development of New England manufactures and the rise of new factory villages and towns”.&lt;ref name=&quot;agr2&quot;/&gt; This brought about significant changes to the agricultural system in the region, specifically through new demands for raw materials and food. Though demand was quick to change, supply remained fixed for a long period of time due to the “inherent inflexibility of the agricultural industry”.&lt;ref name=&quot;agr2&quot;/&gt; However, with the development of railroads by 1840, supply was pretty much forced to change and meet demand. This occurred due to the sudden drop in transportation costs,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;25b. Early American Railroads.&quot; Early American Railroads [ushistory.org]. N.p., n.d. Web. 01 Apr. 2013. &lt;http://www.ushistory.org/us/25b.asp&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus how competitive the agricultural sector became as a result of the newer farms utilizing newer technologies in the New York area. Farmers elsewhere in New England had to institute similar changes in capital to match the increase in competition by making farming in plantations more efficient and productive.&lt;ref name=&quot;agr2&quot;/&gt; Though such changes were made reluctantly, they were the steps that resulted in what would thereafter be referred to as an agricultural revolution.

==Other Northern Colony Planting==

 Though most plantations and large farms in Northern colonies were in New England, New York and other Mid-Atlantic Colonies also had a large agriculture industry. One notable farm or &quot;plantation&quot; in New York is the Montskill Estate.

==Conclusion==

Evident from the evolution of agricultural systems, products, and significance in the region, plantations in New England clearly played an important role in ensuring that local demand for food was satisfied by local supply, and that profit-opportunities in the sector were exhausted through utilization of technological changes that occurred in the colonial era.

'''American philosophy''' is the [[philosophical]] activity or output of Americans, both within the [[United States]] and abroad. The ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' notes that while it lacks a &quot;core of defining features, American Philosophy can nevertheless be seen as both reflecting and shaping collective American identity over the history of the nation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AmerIEP&quot;&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/american.htm &quot;American philosophy&quot; at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved on May 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The political thinker and historian [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] gave his own more detailed definition of a &quot;Philosophical Method Among the Americans&quot; in the opening paragraph of Book Two of ''[[Democracy In America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tocqueville, Alexis, translated by Henry Reeve, ''Democracy in America: Part the Second: The Social Influence of Democracy'', Volume 2, Democracy in America: Part the Second: The Social Influence of Democracy, J. &amp; H. G. Langley; Philadelphia, Thomas, Cowperthwaite &amp; Company, 1840, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think that in no country in the civilized world is less attention paid to philosophy than in the United States... Nevertheless it is easy to perceive that almost all the inhabitants of the United States conduct their understanding in the same manner, and govern it by the same rules; that is to say, that without ever having taken the trouble to define the rules of a philosophical method, they are in possession of one, common to the whole people. To evade the bondage of system and habit, of family maxims, class opinions, and, in some degree, of national prejudices; to accept tradition only as a means of information, and existing facts only as a lesson used in doing otherwise, and doing better; to seek the reason of things for one's self, and in one's self alone; to tend to results without being bound to means, and to aim at the substance through the form; – such are the principal characteristics of what I shall call the philosophical method of the Americans...[In] most of the operations of the mind, each American appeals to the individual exercise of his own understanding alone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==17th century==
{{See also|17th century philosophy}}

The American philosophical tradition began at the time of the [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] of the [[New World]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AmerIEP&quot;/&gt; The [[Puritans]] arrival in [[New England]] set the earliest American philosophy into the religious tradition (Puritan [[Providentialism]]), and there was also an emphasis on the relationship between the individual and the community. This is evident by the early colonial documents such as the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]] (1639) and the [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] (1641).&lt;ref name=&quot;AmerIEP&quot;/&gt;

Thinkers such as [[John Winthrop]] emphasized the public life over the private, holding that the former takes precedence over the latter, while other writers, such as [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] (co-founder of [[Rhode Island]]) held that [[religious tolerance]] was more integral than trying to achieve religious homogeneity in a community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/historyofus/web03/segment2.html &quot;Religious Tolerance&quot; - Freedom: A History of US: PBS.com] Retrieved September 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
{{See also|18th century philosophy}}

18th-century American philosophy may be broken into two halves, the first half being marked by the theology of Reformed [[Puritan]] [[Calvinism]] influenced by the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] as well as Enlightenment natural philosophy, and the second by the native [[moral philosophy]] of the [[American Enlightenment]] taught in American colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeveler, J. David, ''Creating the American Mind:Intellect and Politics in the Colonial Colleges'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, ISBN 978-0742548398, 2007, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; They were used &quot;in the tumultuous years of the 1760s and 1770s&quot; to &quot;forge a new intellectual culture for the United states&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Hoeveler, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the American incarnation of the [[European Enlightenment]] that is associated with the [[political thought]] of the Founding Fathers.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmerIEP&quot;/&gt;

The 18th century saw the introduction of [[Francis Bacon]] and the Enlightenment philosophers [[Descartes]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[William Wollaston|Wollaston]], and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] to Colonial British America. Two Native Americans, [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Samuel Johnson]] and [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], were first influenced by these philosophers; they then adapted and extended their Enlightenment ideas to develop their own American theology and philosophy. Both were originally ordained Puritan Congregationalist ministers who embraced much of the new learning of the Enlightenment. Both were Yale educated and Berkeley influenced [[idealists]] who became influential college presidents. Both were influential in the development of American [[political philosophy]] and the works of the [[Founding Fathers]]. But Edwards based his reformed Puritan [[theology]] on [[Calvinist]] doctrine, while Johnson converted to the Anglican episcopal religion (the [[Church of England]]), then based his new American [[moral philosophy]] on William Wollaston's [[Natural religion|Natural Religion]]. Late in the century, [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|Scottish Innate or Common Sense Realism]] replaced the native schools of these two rivals in the college philosophy curricula of American colleges; it would remain the dominant philosophy in American academia up to the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeveler, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of the Enlightenment into America===
[[File:American Dr. Samuel Johnson President of King's College by Smibert c. 1730.jpg|thumb|[[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Samuel Johnson]]]]
The first 100 years or so of college education in  the American Colonies were dominated in New England by the Puritan theology of [[William Ames]] and &quot;the sixteenth-century logical methods of [[Petrus Ramus]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom, Sydney Eckman, ''A Religious History of the American People'', Yale University Press, 1972, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1714, a donation of 800 books from England, collected by [[Colonial agent|Colonial Agent]] [[Jeremiah Dummer]], arrived at [[Yale University|Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Joseph J., ''The New England Mind in Transition: Samuel Johnson of Connecticut, 1696-1772,'' Yale University Press, 1973, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  They contained what became known as &quot;The New Learning&quot;, including &quot;the works of Locke, Descartes, Newton, [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], and [[Shakespeare]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Enlightenment Era|Enlightenment era]] authors not known to the tutors and graduates of Puritan [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] colleges. They were first opened and studied by an eighteen-year-old graduate student from [[Guilford, Connecticut]], the young American [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Samuel Johnson]], who had also just found and read [[Francis Bacon|Lord Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[Advancement of Learning]].'' Johnson wrote in his ''Autobiography'', &quot;All this was like a flood of day to his low state of mind&quot;, and that &quot;he found himself like one at once emerging out of the glimmer of twilight into the full sunshine of open day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Herbert and Carol,'' Samuel Johnson, President of King's College: His Career and Writings'', Columbia University Press, 4 vols., 1929, Volume I, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; He now considered what he had learned at Yale &quot;nothing but the scholastic cobwebs of a few little English and Dutch systems that would hardly now be taken up in the street.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Volume I, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was appointed tutor at Yale in 1716. He began to teach the Enlightenment curriculum there, and thus began the [[American Enlightenment]]. One of his students for a brief time was a fifteen-year-old Johnathan Edwards. &quot;These two brilliant Yale students of those years, each of whom was to become a noted thinker and college president, exposed the fundamental nature of the problem&quot; of the &quot;incongruities between the old learning and the new.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;  But each had a quite different view on the issues of [[predestination]] versus [[freewill]], [[original sin]] versus the pursuit of happiness though practicing [[virtue]], and the education of children.

===Reformed Calvinism===
[[File:Rev. Dr. Jonathan Edwards (1837 engraving).jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]]]
[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] is considered to be &quot;America's most important and original philosophical theologian.&quot;&lt;ref name = SEPJEdwards&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/edwards/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,'' &quot;Jonathan Edwards,&quot; First published Tue Jan 15, 2002; substantive revision Tue Nov 7, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Noted for his energetic sermons, such as &quot;[[Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God]]&quot; (which is said to have begun the [[First Great Awakening]]), Edwards emphasized &quot;the absolute sovereignty of God and the beauty of God's holiness.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SEPJEdwards&quot;/&gt; Working to unite Christian [[Platonism]] with an [[empiricist]] [[epistemology]], with the aid of [[Newtonian physics]], Edwards was deeply influenced by [[George Berkeley]], himself an empiricist, and Edwards derived his importance of the immaterial for the creation of human experience from Bishop Berkeley.

The non-material mind consists of understanding and will, and it is understanding, interpreted in a Newtonian framework, that leads to Edwards' fundamental metaphysical category of Resistance. Whatever features an object may have, it has these properties because the object resists. Resistance itself is the exertion of God's power, and it can be seen in [[Newton's laws of motion]], where an object is &quot;unwilling&quot; to change its current state of motion; an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion.

Though Edwards reformed Puritan theology using Enlightenment ideas from natural philosophy, and Locke, Newton, and Berkeley, he remained a Calvinist and [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism#Hard Determinism|hard determinist]]. Jonathan Edwards also rejected the [[Free will|freedom of the will]], saying that &quot;we can do as we please, but we cannot please as we please.&quot; According to Edwards, neither good works nor self-originating faith lead to salvation, but rather it is the unconditional grace of God which stands as the sole arbiter of human fortune.

===Enlightenment===
While the 17th- and early 18th-century American philosophical tradition was decidedly marked by religious themes and the Reformation reason of Ramus, the 18th century saw more reliance on [[science]] and the new learning of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], along with an idealist belief in the perfectibility of human beings through teaching [[ethics]] and [[moral philosophy]], [[laissez-faire]] [[economics]], and a new focus on political matters.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;American philosophy&quot; at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Retrieved on May 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Samuel Johnson]] has been called &quot;The Founder of American Philosophy&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, James, ''Education of the Founding Fathers of the Republic: Scholasticism in the Colonial Colleges'', Fordham University Press, New York, 1925, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;first important philosopher in colonial America and author of the first philosophy textbook published there&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Ed. Edward Craig, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; He was interested not only in philosophy and theology, but in theories of education, and in knowledge classification schemes, which he used to write [[encyclopedias]], develop [[Curricula|college curricula]], and create [[library classification]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Fiering, Norman S., &quot;President Samuel Johnson and the Circle of Knowledge&quot;, ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, Vol. 28, No. 2 (Apr., 1971), pp. 199-236&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was a proponent of the view that &quot;the essence of true religion is [[morality]]&quot;, and believed that &quot;the problem of [[denominationalism]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fiering, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; could be solved by teaching a non-denominational common moral philosophy acceptable to all religions. So he crafted one. Johnson's moral philosophy was influenced by Descartes and Locke, but more directly by [[William Wollaston]]'s ''Religion of Nature Delineated'' and the idealist philosopher of George Berkeley, with whom Johnson studied while Berkley was in Rhode Island between 1729 and 1731. Johnson strongly rejected Calvin's doctrine of Predestination and believed that people were autonomous moral agents endowed with freewill and Lockean [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]. His fusion philosophy of Natural Religion and Idealism, which has been called &quot;American Practical Idealism&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Neil C., ''Pursuing Happiness: The Organizational Culture of the Continental Congress'', Nonagram Publications, ISBN 978-1480065505 ISBN 1480065501, 2013, p. 158 n24.&lt;/ref&gt; was developed as a series of college textbooks in seven editions between 1731 and 1754. These works, and his dialogue ''Raphael, or The Genius of the English America, ''written at the time of the [[Stamp Act crisis]], go beyond his Wollaston and Berkeley influences;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Adam Leroy, ''Early American philosophers'', Volume 2, Issue 4 of Columbia University contributions to philosophy, psychology and education, The Macmillan Co., 1898, Volume 2, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; ''Raphael ''includes sections on [[economics]], [[psychology]], the teaching of children, and [[political philosophy]].

His moral philosophy is defined in his college textbook ''Elementa Philosophica'' as &quot;the Art of pursuing our highest Happiness by the practice of virtue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Herbert and Carol, ''Samuel Johnson, President of King's College: His Career and Writings'', Columbia University Press, 4 vols., 1929, Volume II, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; It was promoted by President [[Thomas Clap]] of Yale, [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[William Smith (Episcopalian priest)|Provost William Smith]] at [[The Academy and College of Philadelphia]], and taught at [[Columbia College, Columbia University|King's College]] (now [[Columbia University]]), which Johnson founded in 1754. It was influential in its day: it has been estimated that about half of American college students between 1743 and 1776,&lt;ref&gt;Olsen p. 176 n65&lt;/ref&gt; and over half of the men who contributed to the ''Declaration of Independence'' or debated it&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Appendix I: Morality, pp. 299-300&lt;/ref&gt; were connected to Johnson's American Practical Idealism moral philosophy. Three members of the [[Committee of Five]] who edited the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'' were closely connected to Johnson: his educational partner, promoter, friend, and publisher [[Benjamin Franklin]] of [[Pennsylvania]], his King's College student [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], and his son [[William Samuel Johnson]]'s legal protegee and Yale treasurer [[Roger Sherman]] of [[Connecticut]]. Johnson's son William Samuel Johnson was the Chairman of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Committee of Style]] that wrote the U.S. Constitution: [http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/Ratification/ExhibitObjects/ReportoftheCommitteeofStyle.aspx edits to a draft version]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/Ratification/ExhibitObjects/ReportoftheCommitteeofStyle.aspx Report of the Committee of Style]&quot;, Retrieved on September 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; are in his hand in the [[Library of Congress]].

===Founders' political philosophy===
[[File:Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Thomas Jefferson]] by [[Rembrandt Peale]], 1800]]
About the time of the [[Stamp Act]], interest rose in civil and [[political philosophy]]. Many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] wrote extensively on political issues, including [[John Adams]], [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Jay]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[James Madison]]. In continuing with the chief concerns of the Puritans in the 17th century, the Founding Fathers debated the interrelationship between God, the state, and the individual. Resulting from this were the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence]]'', passed in 1776, and the ''[[United States Constitution]]'', ratified in 1788.

The Constitution sets forth a [[federated]] [[republic]]an form of [[government]] that is marked by a [[balance of powers]] accompanied by a [[checks and balances]] system between the three branches of government: a [[judicial branch]], an [[executive branch]] led by the [[President of the United States|President]], and a [[legislative branch]] composed of a [[bicameral legislature]] where the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is the [[lower house]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] is the [[upper house]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/constitution/article-1/02-bicameralism.html &quot;Bicameralism and Enumerated, Implied, Resulting, and Inherent Powers&quot;] Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ''Declaration of Independence'' does contain within it references to the Creator, the God of Nature, Divine Providence, and the Supreme Judge of the World, the Founding Fathers were not exclusively [[theism|theistic]]. Some professed personal concepts of [[deism]], as was characteristic of other European Enlightenment thinkers, such as [[Maximilien Robespierre]], [[François-Marie Arouet]] (better known by his [[pen name]], [[Voltaire]]), and [[Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/od/churchstatemyths/a/doi.htm &quot;Declaration of Independence &amp; Christianity Myth&quot;] Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  However, an investigation of 106 contributors to the ''Declaration of Independence'' between September 5, 1774 and July 4, 1776 found only two men (Franklin and Jefferson), both American Practical Idealists in their moral philosophy, might be called quasi-deists or non-denominational Christians;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; all the others were publicly members of denominational Christian churches. Even Franklin professed the need for a &quot;public religion&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin, ''The works of Benjamin Franklin'', ed. Jared Sparks, Hillard, Gray, 1840, p. 573&lt;/ref&gt; and would attend various churches from time to time. Jefferson was vestryman at the evangelical Calvinistical Reformed Church of [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] a church he himself founded and named in 1777,&lt;ref&gt;Belies, Mark A., &quot;Rev. Charles Clay, and the Calvinistical Reformed Church of Charlottesville, Virginia During the American Revolution&quot;, ''Providential Perspective'', Volume 12, No. 3, August 1977, pp. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that at this time of life he was rather strongly affiliated with a denomination, and that the influence of Whitefield and Edwards reached even into Virginia. But the founders who studied or embraced Johnson, Franklin, and Smith's non-denominational moral philosophy were at least influenced by the deistic tendencies of Wollaston's Natural Region, as evidenced by &quot;the Laws of Nature, and Nature's God&quot; and &quot;the pursuit of Happiness&quot; in the ''Declaration''.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Woodbridge, ''American philosophy: the early schools,'' Dodd, Mead, 1907, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate moral philosophy to the domestic American Practical Idealism, called variously Scottish Innate Sense moral philosophy (by Jefferson),&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, Thomas, ''The Political Writings of Thomas Jefferson'', UNC Press Books, 1993, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish Commonsense Philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Richard, ''A Critical History of Philosophy, ''2003, Volume 1, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Scottish Common Sense Realism]], was introduced into American Colleges in 1768&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; by [[John Witherspoon]], a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] immigrant and educator who was invited to be President of the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]). He was a [[Presbyterian]] minister, and a delegate who joined the [[Continental Congress]] just days before the ''Declaration'' was debated. His moral philosophy was based on the work of the Scottish philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], who also influenced John Adams.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; When President Witherspoon arrived at the College of New Jersey in 1768, he expanded its natural philosophy offerings, purged the Berkeley adherents from the faculty, including [[Jonathan Edwards (the younger)|Johnathan Edwards, Jr.]], and taught his own Hutcheson influenced form of Scottish innate sense moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 388 n81&lt;/ref&gt; Some revisionist commentators, including Garry Wills' ''Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence'', claimed in the 1970s that this imported Scottish philosophy was the basis for the founding documents of America.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, Garry, ''Inventing America : Jefferson's Declaration of Independence'', Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dimock, Wai Chee, ''Residues of Justice: Literature, Law, Philosophy'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 195 and p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other historians have questioned this assertion. Ronald Hamowy published a critique of Garry Wills's ''Inventing America'',&lt;ref&gt;Hamowy, Ronald, Jefferson and the Scottish Enlightenment: &quot;A Critique of Garry Wills's Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence&quot;, ''William and Mary Quarterly', Third Series, Vol. 36, No. 4, Oct., 1979, pp. 503-523&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that &quot;the moment [Will's] statements are subjected to scrutiny, they appear a mass of confusions, uneducated guesses, and blatant errors of fact.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hamowy, p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;  Another investigation of all of the contributors to the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence]]'' suggests that only Jonathan Witherspoon and John Adams embraced the imported Scottish morality.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; While Scottish innate sense realism would in the decades after the Revolution become the dominate moral philosophy in classrooms of American academia for almost 100 years,&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom, Sydney, E., ''The Scottish Philosophy and American Theology Church History'', Vol. 24, No. 3 (Sep., 1955), pp. 257-272&lt;/ref&gt; it was not a strong influence at the time of the ''Declaration'' was crafted.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Joseph J., ''American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson'', Random House Digital, Inc., 1998, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's American Practical Idealism  and Edwards' Reform Puritan Calvinism were far stronger influences on the men of the Continental Congress and on the ''Declaration''.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Paine]], the English [[intellectual]], [[pamphleteer]], and [[revolutionary]] who wrote [[Common Sense (pamphlet)|''Common Sense'']] and ''[[Rights of Man]]'' was an influential promoter of Enlightenment political ideas in America, though he was not a philosopher.

==19th century==
{{See also|19th century philosophy}}

The 19th century saw the rise of [[Romanticism]] in America. The American incarnation of Romanticism was [[transcendentalism]] and it stands as a major American innovation. The 19th century also saw the rise of the school of pragmatism, along with a smaller, [[Hegelian]] philosophical movement led by [[George Holmes Howison]] that was focused in [[St. Louis]], though the influence of American pragmatism far outstripped that of the small Hegelian movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmerIEP&quot;/&gt;

Other reactions to materialism included the &quot;[[Objective idealism]]&quot; of [[Josiah Royce]], and the &quot;[[Personalism]],&quot; sometimes called &quot;Boston personalism,&quot; of [[Borden Parker Bowne]].

===Transcendentalism===
[[File:Henry David Thoreau.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Henry David Thoreau]], 1856]]
[[File:Ralph Waldo Emerson ca1857.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], ca. 1857]]
[[Transcendentalism]] in the United States was marked by an emphasis on subjective experience, and can be viewed as a reaction against [[modernism]] and [[intellectualism]] in general and the mechanistic, [[reductionism|reductionistic]] worldview in particular. Transcendentalism is marked by the [[holism|holistic]] belief in an ideal spiritual state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical, and this perfect state can only be attained by one's own intuition and personal reflection, as opposed to either industrial progress and scientific advancement or the principles and prescriptions of traditional, organized religion. The most notable transcendentalist writers include [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], and [[Margaret Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/largecom/fam_transcendentalist.html &quot;Famous Transcendentalists&quot;] Retrieved September 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The transcendentalist writers all desired a deep return to [[nature]], and believed that real, true knowledge is intuitive and personal and arises out of personal immersion and reflection in nature, as opposed to scientific knowledge that is the result of [[empirical evidence|empirical sense experience]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/ &quot;Transcendentalism&quot; at the SEP] Retrieved September 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Things such as scientific tools, political institutions, and the conventional rules of morality as dictated by traditional religion need to be transcended. This is found in [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden; or, Life in the Woods]]'' where transcendence is achieved through immersion in nature and the distancing of oneself from society.

===Darwinism in America===
The release of [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[evolutionary theory]] in his 1859 publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' had a strong impact on American philosophy. [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]] and [[Chauncey Wright]] both wrote about and argued for the re-conceiving of philosophy through an evolutionary lens. They both wanted to understand [[morality]] and the [[mind]] in Darwinian terms, setting a precedent for [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[evolutionary ethics]].

Darwin's biological theory was also integrated into the social and political philosophies of [[English people|English]] thinker [[Herbert Spencer]] and American philosopher [[William Graham Sumner]]. Herbert Spencer, who coined the oft-misattributed term &quot;[[survival of the fittest]],&quot; believed that societies were in a struggle for survival, and that groups within society are where they are because of some level of fitness. This struggle is beneficial to human kind, as in the long run the weak will be weeded out and only the strong will survive. This position is often referred to as [[Social Darwinism]], though it is distinct from the [[eugenics]] movements with which social darwinism is often associated.  The [[laissez-faire]] beliefs of Sumner and Spencer do not advocate coercive breeding to achieve a planned outcome.

Sumner, much influenced by Spencer, believed along with the industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]] that the social implication of the fact of the struggle for survival is that laissez-faire capitalism is the natural political-economic system and is the one that will lead to the greatest amount of well-being. William Sumner, in addition to his advocacy of free markets, also espoused [[anti-imperialism]] (having been credited with coining the term &quot;[[ethnocentrism]]&quot;), and advocated for the [[gold standard]].

===Pragmatism===
Perhaps the most influential school of thought that is uniquely American is [[pragmatism]]. It began in the late nineteenth century in the United States with [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]]. Pragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that upon which one is willing to act. It holds that a proposition's meaning is the consequent form of conduct or practice that would be implied by accepting the proposition as true.&lt;ref name=&quot;IEPrag&quot;&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/pragmati.htm &quot;Pragmatism&quot; at IEP] Retrieved on July 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charles Sanders Peirce====
[[File:Charles Sanders Peirce theb3558.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], an American pragmatist, logician, mathematician, philosopher, and scientist]]

[[Polymath]], [[logician]], [[mathematician]], philosopher, and [[scientist]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɜr|s}} like &quot;purse&quot;; 1839–1914) coined the term &quot;pragmatism&quot; in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/10825/Pragmatism-Charles-Sanders-Peirce.html &quot;Pragmatism - Charles Sanders Peirce&quot;] Retrieved September 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of [[The Metaphysical Club]], which was a conversational club of intellectuals that also included [[Chauncey Wright]], future [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], and another early figure of pragmatism, [[William James]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IEPrag&quot;/&gt; In addition to making profound contributions to [[semiotics]], logic, and mathematics, Peirce wrote what are considered to be the founding documents of pragmatism, &quot;[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]&quot; (1877) and [[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|&quot;How to Make Our Ideas Clear&quot;]] (1878).

In &quot;The Fixation of Belief&quot; Peirce argues for the superiority of the [[scientific method]] in settling belief on theoretical questions. In &quot;How to Make Our Ideas Clear&quot; Peirce argued for pragmatism as summed up in that which he later called the [[pragmatic maxim]]: &quot;Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object&quot;. Peirce emphasized that a conception is general, such that its meaning is not a set of actual, definite effects themselves. Instead the conception of an object is equated to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of their conceivable implications for informed practice. Those conceivable practical implications are the conception's meaning.

The maxim is intended to help fruitfully clarify confusions caused, for example, by distinctions that make formal but not practical differences. Traditionally one analyzes an idea into parts (his example: a definition of truth as a sign's correspondence to its object). To that needful but confined step, the maxim adds a further and practice-oriented step (his example: a definition of truth as sufficient investigation's destined end).

It is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental [[Pragmatic maxim#6|reflection]]&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, paragraph 13, note 1. See relevant quote at [[Pragmatic maxim#6]].&lt;/ref&gt; arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances — a method hospitable to the formation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the use and improvement of verification.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'', v. 1, paragraph 34, [http://www.textlog.de/4220.html Eprint] (in &quot;The Spirit of Scholasticism&quot;), where Peirce ascribes the success of modern science less to a novel interest in verification than to the improvement of verification.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical of Peirce is his concern with inference to explanatory hypotheses as outside the usual foundational alternative between deductivist rationalism and inductivist empiricism, though he himself was a [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Mathematics of logic|mathematician of logic]] and a [[Founders of statistics|founder of statistics]].

[[Charles Sanders Peirce#Philosophy|Peirce's philosophy]] includes a pervasive [[Categories (Peirce)|three-category system]], both [[fallibilism]] and [[Pragmatism#antiskep|anti-skeptical]] belief that truth is discoverable and immutable, [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Philosophy: logic, or semiotic|logic as formal semiotic]] (including [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)|semiotic elements and classes of signs]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|modes of inference]], and [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Pragmatism|methods of inquiry]] along with pragmatism and [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Critical common-sensism|critical common-sensism]]), [[Philosophical realism|Scholastic realism]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Philosophy: metaphysics|theism]], [[objective idealism]], and belief in the reality [[Synechism|of continuity]] of space, time, and law, and in the reality [[Tychism|of absolute chance]], mechanical necessity, and [[Agapism|creative love]] as principles operative in the cosmos and as modes of its evolution.

====William James====
[[File:wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William James]], an American pragmatist and psychologist]]

[[William James]] (1842–1910) was &quot;an original thinker in and between the disciplines of physiology, psychology and philosophy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/james/ &quot;William James&quot; at SEP] Retrieved on July 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He is famous as the author of ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', his monumental tome ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', and his lecture &quot;[[The Will to Believe]].&quot;

James, along with Peirce,&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;Pragmatism (Editor [3])&quot;, c. 1906, especially the portion published in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5 (1934), paragraphs 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes elaborated into a radical new philosophical method of clarifying ideas and thereby resolving dilemmas. In his 1910 ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]],'' James paraphrased Peirce's pragmatic maxim as follows:
{{cquote|[T]he tangible fact at the root of all our thought-distinctions, however subtle, is that there is no one of them so fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of practice. To attain perfect clearness in our thoughts of an object, then, we need only consider what conceivable effects of a practical kind the object may involve — what sensations we are to expect from it, and what reactions we must prepare.}}
He then went on to characterize pragmatism as promoting not only a method of clarifying ideas but also as endorsing a particular theory of truth. Peirce rejected this latter move by James, preferring to describe the pragmatic maxim only as a maxim of logic and pragmatism as a methodological stance, explicitly denying that it was a substantive doctrine or theory about anything, truth or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1903), ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 2, paragraph 99; v. 5, paragraphs 18, 195; v. 6, paragraph 482.&lt;/ref&gt;

James is also known for his [[radical empiricism]] which holds that relations between objects are as real as the objects themselves. James was also a pluralist in that he believed that there may actually be multiple correct accounts of truth. He rejected the [[correspondence theory of truth]] and instead held that truth involves a belief, facts about the world, other background beliefs, and future consequences of those beliefs. Later in his life James would also come to adopt [[neutral monism]], the view that the ultimate [[reality]] is of one kind, and is neither [[Mental substance|mental]] nor [[physical property|physical]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/neutral-monism/ &quot;Neutral Monism&quot;] in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Retrieved September 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====John Dewey====

[[John Dewey]] (1859–1952), while still engaging in the lofty academic philosophical work of James and Peirce before him, also wrote extensively on political and social matters, and his presence in the public sphere was much greater than his pragmatist predecessors. In addition to being one of the founding members of pragmatism, John Dewey was one of the founders of [[functional psychology]] and was a leading figure of the [[Progressive education|progressive]] movement in U.S. schooling during the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Violas, Paul C. |author2=Tozer, Steven |author3=Senese, Guy B. |title=School and Society: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives |publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages |year= |page=121 |isbn=0-07-298556-9 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey argued against the individualism of classical liberalism, asserting that social institutions are not &quot;means for obtaining something for individuals. They are means for creating individuals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dewey-political/#2 &quot;Dewey's Political Philosophy&quot;] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Retrieved on July 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He held that individuals are not things that should be accommodated by social institutions, instead, social institutions are prior to and shape the individuals. These social arrangements are a means of creating individuals and promoting individual freedom.

Dewey is well known for his work in the [[applied philosophy]] of the [[philosophy of education]]. Dewey's philosophy of education is one where children learn by doing. Dewey believed that schooling was unnecessarily long and formal, and that children would be better suited to learn by engaging in real-life activities. For example, in math, students could learn by figuring out proportions in cooking or seeing how long it would take to travel distances with certain modes of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wilderdom.com/experiential/JohnDeweyPhilosophyEducation.html John Dewey: Philosophy of Education&quot;] Retrieved on July 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
[[File:George Santayana.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George Santayana]], a Spanish-American philosopher]]
{{See also|20th-century philosophy}}

Pragmatism, which began in the 19th century in America, by the beginning of the 20th century began to be accompanied by other philosophical schools of thought, and was eventually eclipsed by them, though only temporarily. The 20th century saw the emergence of process philosophy, itself influenced by the scientific world-view and [[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]]. The middle of the 20th century was witness to the increase in popularity of the [[philosophy of language]] and analytic philosophy in America. [[Existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], while very popular in Europe in the 20th century, never achieved the level of popularity in America as they did in continental Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmerIEP&quot;/&gt;

===Rejection of idealism===
Pragmatism continued its influence into the 20th century, and Spanish-born philosopher [[George Santayana]] was one of the leading proponents of pragmatism in this period. He held that [[idealism]] was an outright contradiction and rejection of [[common sense]]. He held that, if something must be certain in order to be knowledge, then it seems no knowledge may be possible, and the result will be [[skepticism]]. According to Santayana, knowledge involved a sort of faith, which he termed &quot;animal faith.&quot;

In his book ''[[Scepticism and Animal Faith]]'' he asserts that knowledge is not the result of reasoning. Instead, knowledge is what is required in order to act and successfully engage with the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/santayana/ &quot;George Santayana&quot; at the Stanford Encylclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved September 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As a naturalist, Santayana was a harsh critic of [[Foundationalism|epistemological foundationalism]]. The explanation of events in the natural world is within the realm of science, while the meaning and value of this action should be studied by philosophers. Santayana was accompanied in the intellectual climate of 'common sense' philosophy by the thinkers of the [[New Realism]] movement, such as [[Ralph Barton Perry]].

===Process philosophy===
[[Process philosophy]] embraces the Einsteinian world-view, and its main proponents include [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]]. The core belief of process philosophy is the claim that events and processes are the principal [[ontological]] categories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-philosophy/ &quot;Process Philosophy&quot; at the SEP] Retrieved on September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead asserted in his book ''The Concept of Nature'' that the things in nature, what he referred to as &quot;concresences&quot; are a conjunction of events that maintain a permanence of character. Process philosophy is [[Heraclitan]] in the sense that a fundamental ontological category is change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://websyte.com/alan/process.htm &quot;Process Philosophy and the New Thought Movement&quot;] {{wayback|url=http://websyte.com/alan/process.htm |date=20090826153844 }} Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Hartshorne was also responsible for developing the process philosophy of Whitehead into [[process theology]].

===Analytic philosophy===
[[File:Wvq-passport-1975-400dpi-crop.jpg|thumb|upright|An image of [[W.V.O. Quine]] as seen on his [[passport]]]]
The middle of the 20th century was the beginning of the dominance of [[analytic philosophy]] in America. Analytic philosophy, prior to its arrival in America, had begun in Europe with the work of [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and the [[logical positivists]]. According to logical positivism, the truths of logic and mathematics are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and those of science are empirically verifiable.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Any other claim, including the claims of ethics, aesthetics, theology, metaphysics, and ontology, are meaningless (this theory is called [[verificationism]]). With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], many positivists fled [[Germany]] to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and America, and this helped reinforce the dominance of analytic philosophy in the United States in subsequent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmerIEP&quot;/&gt;

[[W.V.O. Quine]], while not a logical positivist, shared their view that philosophy should stand shoulder to shoulder with science in its pursuit of intellectual clarity and understanding of the world. He criticized the logical positivists and the [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic distinction of knowledge]] in his essay &quot;[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]&quot; and advocated for his &quot;web of belief,&quot; which is a [[coherentism|coherentist]] theory of justificiation. In Quine's epistemology, since no experiences occur in isolation, there is actually a holistic approach to knowledge where every belief or experience is intertwined with the whole. Quine is also famous for inventing the term &quot;gavagai&quot; as part of his theory of the [[indeterminacy of translation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nickbostrom.com/old/quine.html &quot;UNDERSTANDING QUINE'S THESES OF INDETERMINACY&quot; by Nick Bostrom] Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Kuhn]] was an important philosopher and writer who worked extensively in the fields of the [[history of science]] and the [[philosophy of science]]. He is famous for writing ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', one of the most cited academic works of all time. The book argues that science proceeds through different ''[[paradigms]]'' as scientists find new puzzles to solve. There follows a widespread struggle to find answers to questions, and a shift in world views occurs, which is referred to by Kuhn as a ''[[paradigm shift]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/#3 &quot;Thomas Kuhn&quot; at the SEP] Retrieved on September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The work is considered a milestone in the [[sociology of knowledge]].

===Return of political philosophy===
The analytic philosophers troubled themselves with the abstract and the conceptual, and American philosophy did not fully return to social and political concerns (that dominated American philosophy at the time of the founding of the United States) until the 1970s.

[[File:Ayn Rand.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ayn Rand]], founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]]]
The return to political and social concerns included the popularity of works of [[Ayn Rand]], who promoted [[ethical egoism]] (the praxis of the belief system she called [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]) in her novels, ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' in 1943 and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' in 1957. These two novels gave birth to the [[Objectivist movement]] and would influence a small group of students called The Collective, one of whom was a young [[Alan Greenspan]], a self-described libertarian who would become [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]].&lt;ref name&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Greg |last1=Ip |first2=Emily |last2=Steel |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118978549183327730.html |title=Greenspan Book Criticizes Bush And Republicans |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=September 15, 2007 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivism holds that there is an objective external reality that can be known with reason, that human beings should [[ethical egoism|act in accordance with their own rational self-interest]], and that the proper form of economic organization is [[laissez-faire]] capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_intro &quot;INTRODUCING OBJECTIVISM&quot; by Ayn Rand] Retrieved on September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Academic philosophers have been highly critical of the quality and intellectual rigor of Rand's work,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato-unbound.org/2010/01/20/roderick-long/the-winnowing-of-ayn-rand/ &quot;The Winnowing of Ayn Rand&quot; by Roderick Long] Retrieved July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/the-philosophical-art-of-looking-out-number-one-1.835066 &quot;The philosophical art of looking out number one&quot; at heraldscotland] Retrieved July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but she remains a popular, albeit controversial, figure within the American libertarian movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/rand/ &quot;Ayn Rand&quot; at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/special/threewomen/rand.html &quot;Profile of Ayn Rand at the Cato Institute] {{wayback|url=http://www.cato.org/special/threewomen/rand.html |date=20100728105617 }} Retrieved July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 [[John Rawls]] published his book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''. The book puts forth Rawls' view of ''[[justice as fairness]]'', one which is based on a form of [[social contract]] theory. Rawls employs the use of a conceptual mechanism called the [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]] to outline his idea of the [[original position]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeffersonswall.blog-city.com/john_rawls_vs_robert_nozick.htm &quot;Philosophy: John Rawls vs. Robert Nozick&quot;] {{wayback|url=http://jeffersonswall.blog-city.com/john_rawls_vs_robert_nozick.htm |date=20090616174432 }} Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rawls' philosophy, the original position is the correlate to the [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] [[state of nature]]. While in the original position, persons are said to be behind the veil of ignorance, which makes these persons unaware of their individual characteristics and their place in society, such as their race, religion, wealth, etc. The principles of justice are chosen by rational persons while in this original position. The two principles of justice are the equal liberty principle and the principle which governs the distribution of social and economic inequalities. From this, Rawls argues for a system of [[distributive justice]] in accordance with the Difference Principle, which says that all social and economic inequalities must be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/ &quot;Distributive Justice&quot; at SEP] Retrieved December 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewing Rawls as promoting excessive government control and rights violations, [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Robert Nozick]] published ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' in 1974. The book advocates for a [[minarchism|minimal state]] and defends the liberty of the individual. He argues that the role of government should be limited to &quot;police protection, national defense, and the administration of courts of law, with all other tasks commonly performed by modern governments – education, social insurance, welfare, and so forth – taken over by religious bodies, charities, and other private institutions operating in a free market.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/nozick/ &quot;Robert Nozick (1938—2002)&quot; at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Nozick asserts his view of the [[entitlement theory]] of justice, which says that if everyone in society has acquired their holdings in accordance with the principles of acquisition, transfer, and rectification, then any pattern of allocation, no matter how unequal the distribution may be, is just. The entitlement theory of justice holds that the &quot;justice of a distribution is indeed determined by certain historical circumstances (contrary to end-state theories), but it has nothing to do with fitting any pattern guaranteeing that those who worked the hardest or are most deserving have the most shares.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/nozick/ &quot;Robert Nozick&quot; at IEP] Retrieved January 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

He is responsible for the resurgence of interest in [[virtue ethics]], a [[Ethics|moral theory]] first propounded by the ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/09/004-the-virtues-of-alasdair-macintyre-6 &quot;The Virtues of Alasdair MacIntyre&quot;] {{wayback|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/09/004-the-virtues-of-alasdair-macintyre-6 |date=20120712211034 }} Retrieved on September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/ &quot;Virtue Ethics&quot; at SEP] Retrieved on September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered the preeminent [[Thomism|Thomist]] political philosopher.

Outside [[academic]] philosophy, political and social concerns took center stage with the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the writings of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]

===Feminism===
[[File:Betty Friedan 1960.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Betty Friedan]]]]
{{See also| History of feminism}}
While there were earlier writers who would be considered feminist, such as [[Sarah Grimké]], [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[Anne Hutchinson]], the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, also known as [[second-wave feminism]], is notable for its impact in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-topics/ &quot;Topics in Feminism&quot; at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular mind was taken with [[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]''. This was accompanied by other feminist philosophers, such as [[Alicia Ostriker]] and [[Adrienne Rich]]. These philosophers critiqued basic assumptions and values of philosophy, such as objectivity and what they believe to be masculine approaches to ethics, for example, rights-based political theories. They wrote that there is no such thing as a value-neutral inquiry and they sought to analyze the social dimensions of philosophical issues.

[[File:Hilary Putnam.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hilary Putnam]]]]
Towards the end of the 20th century there was a resurgence of interest in pragmatism. Largely responsible for this are [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Richard Rorty]]. Rorty is famous as the author of ''[[Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature]]'' and ''[[Philosophy and Social Hope]]''. Hilary Putnam is well known for his [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilary Putnam|Putnam, Hilary]], 1975, ''Mind, Language, and Reality. Philosophical Papers, Volume 2''.

The debates that occur within the [[philosophy of mind]] have taken center stage.

In the early 21st century, [[embodied cognition]] has gained strength as a theory of mind-body-world integration. Philosophers such as [[Shaun Gallagher]] and [[Alva Noë]], together with British philosophers such as [[Andy Clark]] defend this view, seeing it as a natural development of [[pragmatism]], and of the thinking of  [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Heidegger]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~gallaghr/situated08.pdf Gallagher, S. 2008(in press). &quot;Philosophical antecedents to situated cognition&quot;.

== History ==

The Society was founded by Allan Nevins and a few colleagues who were critical of what Nevins in a 1939 ''Saturday Review'' article called the &quot;pedantic school&quot; of history--academics who, he said, seemed to take pride in writing badly.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Middlekauff, &quot;Telling the Story of the Civil War: Allan Nevins as a Narrative Historian,&quot; ''Huntington Library Quarterly'' 56 (Winter, 1993): 72&lt;/ref&gt; Nevins, who taught history for over 35 years at Columbia University, was the author of more than 50 books, including an eight-volume history of the American Civil War and biographies of John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford, and Grover Cleveland (which won the 1933  [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]]). A journalist for fifteen years before coming to Columbia (he never earned a Ph.D.), Nevins was the master of a robust and readable style, and continued throughout his life to write for radio and the popular press.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald L. Fetner, ''Immersed in Great Affairs: Allan Nevins and the Heroic Age of American History'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

In 1954, in an effort to bring good historical writing to a wide audience, the Society collaborated in establishing the magazine  [[American heritage magazine|''American Heritage'']] as a popular illustrated bimonthly.&lt;ref&gt;Mark C. Reynolds, [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/golden-anniversary-1?page=show &quot;Golden Anniversary,&quot; ''American Heritage,'' Nov./Dec. 2004]. Retrieved on 29 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Society has co-published several books authored by members, including ''Profiles in Leadership:  Historians on the Elusive Quality of Greatness,'' edited by  [[Walter Isaacson]] (W. W. Norton, 2010); ''Days of Destiny: Crossroads in American History,'' edited by  [[James M. McPherson]] and  [[Alan Brinkley]] (Dorling Kindersley, 2001); and ''&quot;To the Best of My Ability&quot;: The American Presidents,'' edited by James M. McPherson (Dorling Kindersley, 2000).

== Administration ==

The Society's officers for 2016/17 are [[Tony Horwitz]], president, and [[Mary Kelley]], vice president.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5372">The '''''Commonwealth Club Address''''' (23 September 1932) was a speech made by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in San Francisco on his [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential campaign.]]&lt;ref&gt;Eden, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, pp 353-55&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt said the era of growth and unrestricted entrepreneurship had ended, and the individualism must give way to collective action. He was not at all specific, but he hinted at liberal reforms of the sort that emerged in [[First 100 days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency|The First Hundred  Days]] after his inauguration in March 1933. Scholars rate it among the 100 greatest speeches made by a President in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Houck, ''Commonwealth Club Address: Redefining Individualism, Adjudicating Greatness'' (2004) p 259&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roosevelt's argument==
Roosevelt was long on history and short on specifics. He sketched a philosophical foundation for the [[New Deal]], and ultimately for a [[Second Bill of Rights]] that he was committed to achieving over the course of his administration.  Most historians consider it prophetic regarding the actual content of New Deal liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Houck, p 264&lt;/ref&gt;

The great era of rapid economic growth had ended, Roosevelt argued.&lt;ref&gt;Quotes from  Roosevelt, &quot;Commonwealth Club Address,&quot; [http://cdn.constitutionreader.com/files/pdf/constitution/ch116.pdf online version]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the days when growth was all-important, he agreed that it had been necessary to turn political and economic power over to entrepreneurs who were building the nation.  But the era of economic growth  was over he said;  the entrepreneurs are now dangerous:
: A mere builder of more industrial plants, a creator of more railroad systems, an organizer of more corporations, is as likely to be a danger as a help. The day of the great promoter or the financial Titan, to whom we granted anything if only he would build, or develop, is over.

Roosevelt said that further growth was unnecessary: &quot;Our task now is not discovery or exploitation of natural resources, or necessarily producing more goods.&quot;  What America instead needed to do:
:Is the soberer, less dramatic business of administering resources and plants already in hand, of seeking to reestablish foreign markets for our surplus production, of meeting the problem of underconsumption, of adjusting production to consumption, of distributing wealth and products more equitably, of adapting existing economic organizations to the service of the people. The day of enlightened administration has come.

Parts of his speech had a gloomy tone: &quot;A glance at the situation today only too clearly indicates that equality of opportunity as we have known it no longer exists.&quot; &quot;We are steering a steady course toward economic oligarchy, if we are not there already.&quot;  However he did hint at reforms that would bring about a better world:  &quot;Every man has a right to life; and this means that he has also a right to make a comfortable living.&quot;

Biographer [[Frank Freidel]] emphasizes that Roosevelt wanted government to &quot;act as a regulator for the common good within the existing economic system.&quot; Roosevelt believed his philosophy was in accord with the traditions of Thomas Jefferson and Woodrow Wilson, as modified to deal with a much more complex and mature economic order.&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The response to the speech by  the 2000-member luncheon audience and by the national media was tepid. Some thought it too socialistic; others considered it too academic in tone, especially for its long passages on the lessons of American and European history. Roosevelt did not try to rework his material into simpler speeches. He moved on to other topics, and received a rousing reception to the more usual speech he gave that same evening.&lt;ref&gt;Houck, p 262&lt;/ref&gt;

The speech was written by [[Adolf A. Berle]] and his wife Beatrice, who worked on Roosevelt's campaign office.&lt;ref&gt;Eden, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of coal mining in the United States''' goes back to the 1300s, when the [[Hopi]] Indians used coal. The first use by European people in the United States was in the 1740s, in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fossil.energy.gov/education/energylessons/coal/coal_history.html A brief history of coal mining], US Department of Energy,accessed 7 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Coal was the dominant power source in the United States in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and remains a significant source of energy.

Coal became the largest source of energy in the 1880s, when it overtook wood, and remained the largest source until the early 1950s, when coal was exceeded by petroleum. Coal provided more than half of the nation's energy from the 1880s to the 1940s, and from 1906 to 1920 provided more than three-quarters of US energy.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Statistics of the United States'', 1957, US Department of Commerce, p.355.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1800s==
At the start of the 19th century, coal mining was almost all [[bituminous coal]]. In 1810, 176,000 short tons of bituminous coal were mined in the US, versus 2,000 tons of anthracite. US coal mining grew rapidly in the early 1800s, doubling or tripling every decade. Anthracite mining overtook bituminous coal mining in the 1840s, and from 1843 through 1868, more anthracite was mined than bituminous coal. But the more limited deposits of anthracite could not satisfy the increasing demand for coal, and from 1869 on, bituminous coal was the predominant grade of coal mined.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Statistics of the United States'', 1957, US Department of Commerce, p.357-360.&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Anthracite]] (or &quot;hard&quot; coal) exploitation began before the War of 1812 spurred by the interest and opportunism of the Wurt brothers of Philadelphia. Burning clean and smokeless, anthracite became the preferred fuel in cities, replacing [[Wood fuel|wood]] by about 1850, the same pattern seen in Europe. The East became deforested, driving up price of fuel wood. Anthracite from the Northeastern [[Pennsylvania]] [[Coal Region]] and later from [[West Virginia]] was valued for household use because it burns cleanly with little ash. It was also used in the early foundries of Philadelphia, New York, Newark and Allentown. The rich Pennsylvania anthracite fields were close to the big eastern cities, and nearly every major railroad in the Eastern United States such as the [[Reading Company|Reading Railroad]], Lehigh &amp; Erie, Central Railroad of New Jersey, Pennsylvania Railroad and [[Delaware and Hudson Railroad]], extended lines into the anthracite fields. Many railroads began as mining company shortline railroads. By 1840, annual hard coal output had passed the million-short ton mark, and then quadrupled by 1850, and as it grew it pushed railroad construction, mining and steel production in a synergistic symbiosis.

[[Bituminous coal]] (or &quot;soft coal&quot;) mining came later. In the mid-century [[Pittsburgh]] was the principal market. After 1850 soft coal, which is cheaper but dirtier, came into demand for railway locomotives and stationary [[steam engine]]s, and was used to make [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for [[steel]] after 1870.&lt;ref&gt;* Frederick Moore Binder, ''Coal Age Empire: Pennsylvania Coal and Its Utilization to 1860''. Harrisburg: Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Total coal output soared until 1918; before 1890, it doubled every ten years, going from 8.4 million short tons in 1850 to 40 million in 1870, 270 million in 1900, and peaking at 680 million short tons in 1918. New soft coal fields opened in [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]] and [[Illinois]], as well as [[West Virginia]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Alabama]]. The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s lowered the demand to 360 million short tons in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce C. Netschert and Sam H. Schurr, ''Energy in the American Economy, 1850-1975: An Economic Study of Its History and Prospects.'' pp 60-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lackawanna River|Lackawanna Valley]] in [[Pennsylvania]] was rich in [[anthracite]] [[coal]] and [[iron]] deposits. Brothers [[George W. Scranton]] and [[Seldon T. Scranton]] moved to the valley in 1840 and settled in the five-house town of Slocum's Hollow (now Scranton) to establish an iron forge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeomans&quot;&gt;Yeomans, &quot;36 Hours: Scranton, Pa.,&quot; ''New York Times,'' November 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bitter&quot;&gt;&quot;The Bitter Battle,&quot; ''Time,'' October 19, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scrantons succeeded by using a technological innovation in iron smelting, the &quot;[[hot blast]], developed in [[Scotland]] in 1828.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeomans&quot; /&gt; The Scrantons also used anthracite coal to make steel, rather than existing methods which used [[charcoal]] or [[bituminous coal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;Lewis, &quot;The Early History of the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company: A Study in Technological Adaptation,&quot; ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography,'' October 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Virginia===
[[File:Child coal miners (1908) crop.jpg|thumb|Photo of coal miners in West Virginia, 1908]]
In 1883, thousands of European immigrants and a large number of African Americans migrated to southern [[West Virginia]] to work in coal mines. These coal miners worked in company mines with company tools and equipment, which they were required to lease. Along with these expenses, the miners were deducted pay for housing rent and items they purchased from company stores. Many coal companies paid miners with company [[scrip]] (private money), good only at company-owned stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;wvculture.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.wvculture.org/history/minewars.html &quot;West Virginia Division of Culture and History&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the poor economic condition, safety in the mines was a great concern. West Virginia fell behind other states in regulating mining conditions, and between 1890 and 1912, had a higher mine death rate than any other state. West Virginia was the site of the worst coal mining disaster to date, the [[Monongah Mining disaster]] of [[Monongah, West Virginia]] in 1907. The disaster was caused by the ignition of [[methane gas]] (also called &quot;firedamp&quot;), which in turn ignited the [[coal dust]], killing 362 men.  The disaster impelled the [[United States Congress]] to create the [[United States Bureau of Mines|Bureau of Mines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmra.com/saxsewell/historical.htm &quot;United States Mine Rescue Association&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==
Coal-mining employment increased rapidly in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and peaked in 1923 at 798,000.  Since then, the number of miners has fallen considerably since, due to mechanization.

===Accidents===

Since it was founded in 1890, the [[United Mine Workers]] (UMW) labor union has played a key role in United States coal mining. Strikes were very common, the rhetoric employed about exploitation was effective in mobilizing strikers. Detailed analysis of historical data by Fishback (1992) shows that mining wages were as high, if not higher, than those in manufacturing industry; that the prices in company stores were rarely higher than those in independent stores; and that miners who were dissatisfied with working conditions in a particular mining camp could either &quot;vote with their feet&quot; by migrating elsewhere or use the &quot;voice&quot; of collective union action to resist the threatened abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Price V. Fishback, ''Soft Coal, Hard Choices: The Economic Welfare of Bituminous Coal Miners, 1890-1930'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable labor strikes and events include:

* [[Bituminous Coal Miners' Strike of 1894]]
* [[Lattimer Massacre]], 1897
* [[Battle of Virden]], 1898
* [[Coal Strike of 1902]]
* [[Ludlow massacre]], 1914
* [[Herrin Massacre]], 1921 

Under [[John L. Lewis]], the [[United Mine Workers]] became the dominant force in the coal fields in the 1930s and 1940s, producing high wages and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky and Van Tine (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

UMW membership among active miners fell from 160,000 in 1980 to only 16,000 in 2005, as coal mining became more mechanized and non-union miners predominated in the new coal fields in the western states.

==Mechanization==
[[File:Coal mine Wyoming.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Surface coal mining in [[Wyoming]] ]]

Irish mining engineer [[Richard Sutcliffe (engineer)|Richard Sutcliffe]] invented the first [[conveyor belt]] for use in the coal mines of Yorkshire in the early 1900s.  Within the first forty years of the 20th century, more than sixty percent of US coal was loaded mechanically rather than by man power. The history of the industry is the history of increasing mechanization.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Dix,  ''What's a Coal Miner to Do? The Mechanization of Coal Mining'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; As mechanization continued, fewer miners were needed, and some miners reacted with violence. One of the first machines to arrive at [[West Virginia]]’s Kanawha field had to be escorted by armed guards. The same machine introduced at a mine in Illinois was operated at a slow speed because the superintendent feared labor troubles.

Despite resistance, mechanization replaced more and more laborers. By 1940, over 2/3 of coal loaded in the large West Virginia fields was done by machine. With the increase of mechanization came much higher wages for those still employed, but hard times for the former miners because there were very few other jobs in or near the camps. Most moved to the cities to find work, or back to the hills where they started.

[[File:Fig 7-2 Coal Production.jpg|thumb|500px|right|US Coal production since 1949 (US Energy Information Administration)]]

In 1914 at the peak there were 180,000 anthracite miners; by 1970 only 6,000 remained. At the same time steam engines were phased out in railways and factories, and [[bituminous]] was used primarily for the generation of electricity. Employment in bituminous peaked at 705,000 men in 1923, falling to 140,000 by 1970 and 70,000 in 2003. 

During [[World War II]], the [[Solid Fuels Administration for War]] operated government-seized coal mines, either directly or through cooperation with successive Coal Mines Administrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s a series of mergers saw coal production shift from small, independent coal companies to large, more diversified firms. Several oil companies and electricity producers acquired coal companies or leased Federal coal reserves in the west of the United States. Concerns that competition in the coal industry could decline as a result of these changes were heightened by a sharp rise in coal prices in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Coal prices fell in the 1980s, partly in response to oil price decline, but primarily in response to the large increase in supply worldwide which was brought about by the earlier price surge. During this period, the industry in the U.S. moved to low-sulfur coal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/retail.aspx?indid=108&amp;chid=7 &quot;Coal Mining Industry Report&quot;] IBISWorld, 2009''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Wyoming became the largest coal producing state. As of 2014, all but one out of the 18 coal mines in Wyoming were strip mines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/coal/data.cfm#production Coal production by state and mine type], Annual Coal Report 2014, US Energy Information Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; Wyoming's coal reserves total about 69.3 billion tons, or 14.2% of the U.S. coal reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Manuel Lujan|author2=Harry M. Snyder|title=Surface Coal Mining Reclamation: 15 Years of Progress, 1977-1992, Statistical Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9skUgCfSEkC&amp;pg=PA68|year=1992|publisher=DIANE |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, competition was intense in the US coal mining industry with some U.S. mines approaching the end of their useful life ([[mine closure]]). Other coal-producing countries also stepped up production to win a share of traditional US export markets. Coal is used primarily to generate electricity, but the rapid drop in natural gas prices after 2010 created severe competition.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After voting for independence, Congress turned its attention to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], a statement explaining this decision, which had been prepared by a [[Committee of Five]], with [[Thomas Jefferson]] as its principal author. Congress debated and revised the wording of the Declaration, finally approving it two days later on July 4. A day earlier, [[John Adams]] had written to his wife [[Abigail Adams|Abigail]]:

{{quote|The second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America.

It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward forever more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter from John Adams to Abigail Adams, 3 July 1776, 'Had a Declaration…' |url=http://www.masshist.org/digitaladams/aea/cfm/doc.cfm?id=L17760703jasecond |work=Adams Family Papers |publisher=Massachusetts Historical Society |accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Adams's prediction was off by two days. From the outset, Americans celebrated independence on July 4, the date shown on the much-publicized Declaration of Independence, rather than on July 2, the date the resolution of independence was approved in a closed session of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Maier |first=Pauline |authorlink=Pauline Maier |title=Making Sense of the Fourth of July |url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/texttrans/2005/06/20050606131757pssnikwad0.3779871.html#axzz3fMjujpiK |work=American Heritage |date=August 7, 1997 |accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have long disputed whether members of Congress signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4, even though Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and [[Benjamin Franklin]] all later wrote that they had signed it on that day. Most historians have concluded that the Declaration was signed nearly a month after its adoption, on August 2, 1776, and not on July 4 as is commonly believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burnett |first=Edward Cody |year=1941 |title=The Continental Congress |location=New York |publisher=W.W.

Coincidentally, both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the only signers of the Declaration of Independence later to serve as [[President of the United States|Presidents of the United States]], died on the same day: July 4, 1826, which was the 50th anniversary of the Declaration. Although not a signer of the Declaration of Independence, [[James Monroe]], another [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] who was elected as President, also died on July 4, 1831. He was the third President in a row who died on the anniversary of independence. [[Calvin Coolidge]], the 30th President, was born on July 4, 1872; so far he is the only U.S. President to have been born on Independence Day.

==Observance==
* In 1777 thirteen [[gunshot]]s were fired in salute, once at morning and once again as evening fell, on July 4 in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]]. Philadelphia celebrated the first anniversary in a manner a modern American would find quite familiar: an official dinner for the Continental Congress, toasts, [[Saluting guns|13-gun salutes]], speeches, prayers, music, parades, troop reviews, and fireworks. Ships in port were decked with red, white, and blue bunting.&lt;ref name=&quot;heintze_first&quot;&gt;Heintze, &quot;The First Celebrations&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1778, from his headquarters at [[Ross Hall]], near [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], General [[George Washington]] marked July 4 with a double ration of [[rum]] for his soldiers and an artillery salute (''[[feu de joie]]''). Across the Atlantic Ocean, [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassadors]] John Adams and [[Benjamin Franklin]] held a dinner for their fellow Americans in [[Paris]], France.&lt;ref name=&quot;heintze_chron&quot;&gt;Heintze, &quot;A Chronology of Notable Fourth of July Celebration Occurrences&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customs==

Independence Day is a [[National Day|national holiday]] marked by patriotic displays. Similar to other summer-themed events, Independence Day celebrations often take place outdoors. Independence Day is a federal holiday, so all non-essential federal institutions (such as the [[United States Postal Service|postal service]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]) are closed on that day. Many politicians make it a point on this day to appear at a public event to praise the nation's heritage, laws, history, society, and people.

Families often celebrate Independence Day by hosting or attending a picnic or barbecue; many take advantage of the day off and, in some years, a long weekend to gather with relatives or friends. Decorations (''e.g.'', streamers, balloons, and clothing) are generally colored red, white, and blue, the colors of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]. Parades are often held in the morning, before family get-togethers, while fireworks displays occur in the evening after dark at such places as parks, fairgrounds, or town squares.

The night before the Fourth was once the focal point of celebrations, marked by raucous gatherings often incorporating [[bonfires]] as their centerpiece. In [[New England]], towns competed to build towering pyramids, assembled from barrels and casks. They were lit at nightfall, to usher in the celebration. The highest were in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] (on Gallows Hill, the famous site of the execution of 13 women and 6 men for witchcraft in 1692 during the [[Salem witch trials]]), where the tradition of celebratory bonfires had persisted, with pyramids composed of as many as forty tiers of barrels. These made the tallest bonfires ever recorded. The custom flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, and is still practiced in some [[New England]] towns.&lt;ref name=&quot;appelbaum&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Night Before the Fourth |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/07/the-night-before-the-fourth/241259/ |publisher=The Atlantic |date=July 1, 2011|accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence Day [[fireworks]] are often accompanied by patriotic songs such as the [[national anthem]] &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]],&quot;, &quot;[[God Bless America]],&quot;, &quot;[[America the Beautiful]],&quot; &quot;[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]],&quot; &quot;[[This Land Is Your Land]],&quot; &quot;[[Stars and Stripes Forever]],&quot; and, regionally, &quot;[[Yankee Doodle]]&quot; in northeastern states and &quot;[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]&quot; in southern states. Some of the lyrics recall images of the [[Revolutionary War]] or the [[War of 1812]].
[[File:4th of July Independence Day Parade 2014 DC (14466486678).jpg|thumb|Independence Day Parade in Washington, D.C.]]

Firework shows are held in many states, and many fireworks are sold for personal use or as an alternative to a public show. Safety concerns have led some states to ban fireworks or limit the sizes and types allowed. In addition to safety concerns, local and regional weather conditions may dictate whether the sale or use of fireworks in an area will be allowed. Some local or regional firework sales may be limited or prohibited because of dry weather, [[drought]] conditions, or other specific concerns. On these occasions the public may be prohibited from purchasing or discharging fireworks, but professional displays (such as may be found at sport events) may still take place if certain safety precautions have been taken. [[Smuggling|Illicit traffic]] transfers many fireworks from less restrictive states.

A salute of one gun for each state in the United States, called a &quot;salute to the union,&quot; is fired on Independence Day at noon by any capable military base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Origin of the 21-Gun Salute|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/salute.html|publisher=U.S. Army [[Center of Military History]]|date=October 3, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, New York City had the largest fireworks display in the country, with more than 22 tons of pyrotechnics exploded.&lt;ref name=USA/&gt; It generally holds displays in the East River. Other major displays are in Chicago on [[Lake Michigan]]; in San Diego over [[Mission Bay, San Diego, California|Mission Bay]]; in Boston on the [[Charles River]]; in [[St. Louis]] on the [[Mississippi River]]; in San Francisco over the [[San Francisco Bay]]; and on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C.

During the annual [[Windsor-Detroit International Freedom Festival]], [[Detroit, Michigan]] hosts one of the world's largest fireworks displays, over the [[Detroit River]], to celebrate Independence Day in conjunction with [[Windsor, Ontario]]'s celebration of [[Canada Day]].

The first week of July is typically one of the busiest United States travel periods of the year, as many people use what is often a 3-day holiday weekend for extended vacation trips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aaa-chicago-projects-increase-in-fourth-of-july-holiday-travelers-96963819.html &quot;AAA Chicago Projects Increase in Fourth of July Holiday Travelers&quot;], ''PR Newswire,'' 23 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

* Held since 1785, the [[Bristol Fourth of July Parade]] in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]] is the oldest continuous Independence Day celebration in the United States.
* Since 1868, [[Seward, Nebraska]] has held a celebration on the same town square. In 1979 Seward was designated &quot;America's Official Fourth of July City-Small Town USA&quot; by resolution of Congress. Seward has also been proclaimed &quot;Nebraska's Official Fourth of July City&quot; by Governor James Exon in proclamation. Seward is a town of 6,000 but swells to 40,000+ during the July 4 celebrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seward&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Seward Nebraska 4th of July|url=http://www.julyfourthseward.com/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since 1912, the Rebild Society, a Danish-American friendship organization, has held a July 4 weekend festival that serves as a homecoming for Danish-Americans in the [[Rebild municipality]] of [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.rebildfesten.dk/default.asp?pageId=48&amp;mainId=9&amp;lang=UK |work=Rebild Society|publisher=Rebild National Park Society |accessdate=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since 1959, the [[Windsor-Detroit International Freedom Festival|International Freedom Festival]] is jointly held in Detroit, Michigan and [[Windsor, Ontario]] during the last week of June each year as a mutual celebration of Independence Day and [[Canada Day]] (July 1). It culminates in a large fireworks display over the [[Detroit River]].
* The famous [[Macy's]] fireworks display usually held over the [[East River]] in New York City has been televised nationwide on [[NBC]] since 1976. In 2009, the fireworks display was returned to the [[Hudson River]] for the first time since 2000 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of [[Henry Hudson]]'s exploration of that river.&lt;ref name=&quot;macys2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fds.com/pressroom/macys/macysnational/media_kits.asp?mediakit=318 |title= 2009 Macy's 4th of July Fireworks |date=April 29, 2009 |accessdate=July 4, 2009 |publisher=[[Federated Department Stores]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==
[[The Philippines]] celebrates July 4 as its [[Republic Day (Philippines)|Republic Day]] to commemorate that day in 1946 when it ceased to be a [[U.S. territory]] and the United States officially recognized [[History of the Philippines (1946–65)|Philippine Independence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gov.Ph&quot;&gt;{{Citation

July 4 was intentionally chosen by the United States because it corresponds to its Independence Day, and this day was observed in the Philippines as [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Independence Day]] until 1962. In 1964, the name of the July 4 holiday was changed to Republic Day. In Rwanda, July 4 is an official holiday known as [[Liberation Day]], commemorating the end of the [[Rwandan Genocide|1994 Rwandan Genocide]] in which the U.S. government also played a role. A national park in Denmark is said to hold the largest July 4 celebrations outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/blog/20120627-worldwide-weird-celebrate-american-independence-in-denmark |date= Jul 3, 2012 |title= Celebrate American independence in Denmark |author= Lindsey Galloway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Territories of the United States on stamps''' discusses commemorative postal issues devoted to lands that have been ceded to the nation or purchased by treaty in conjunction with both war and peace. Thirteen states have been created from colonial territories, two from independent republics, four from previous states in the Union, and an additional thirty-one from United States territories.

Many aspects of acquisition, settlement and exploration have been celebrated on postage stamps. These are represented below in issues that appeared prior to 1978 (the images of subsequent stamps remain under copyright by the United States Postal Service and may not be reproduced).

==National boundaries==

===Treaty of Paris===
From the territory ceded by Great Britain in the Treaty of Paris 1783, five states were to emerge from the [[Northwest Territory]], two from the [[Southwest Territory]]. States under the [[Articles of Confederation]] ceded their claims to western lands, allowing Congress to administer territories until statehood; the practice was extended under the Constitution. From the Northwest Territory came Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin. From The Southwest Territory came Mississippi and Alabama.

A 3-cent stamp was issued on July 13, 1937, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Northwest Territory as defined by the Ordinance of 1787. The Territory consisted of lands north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi River ceded by eastern states. The Ordinance established the Territory, banned slavery, and specified that land must be purchased from the Indians and offered for sale by the United States. It also made provision for temporary and permanent governments and eventual statehood of included regions based on population. The stamp shows a map of the Territory which is flanked by [[Manasseh Cutler]] who drafted the ordinance, and [[Rufus Putnam]], superintendent of territorial settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Trotter, Gordon T., “Ordinance of 1787 Sesquicentennial Issue”, Arago: people, postage &amp; the post, National Postal Museum online. Viewed March 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The 150th anniversary of establishment of the Mississippi Territory was celebrated by a 3-cent stamp on April 7, 1948. The vignette shows an outline map of the region of today’s Mississippi and Alabama. The present Mississippi is shown in a darker tone. The map is divided into three sections with dates 1798, 1804, and 1812, showing the growth of the Territory. Over the map is the original seal of the Territory on which the second double &quot;s&quot; of Mississippi is written as a single &quot;s.&quot; The portrait is of [[Winthrop Sargent]], first governor of Mississippi Territory.&lt;ref&gt;Trotter, Gordon T., “Mississippi Territory Issue”, Arago: people, postage &amp; the post, National Postal Museum online.

The first expansion beyond Treaty of Paris borders occurred with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803 under President [[Thomas Jefferson]], known as the architect of the Louisiana Purchase.

A map of the 1822 [[Florida Territory]] was pictured on the statehood commemoration from its original state seal on its 100th anniversary by a 3-cent stamp on March 3, 1945.

Texas was annexed in 1845 by Republic of Texas petition to the United States under the presidency of [[James K. Polk]]. The 100th anniversary of Texas statehood was commemorated by a 3-cent stamp on December 29, 1945. The Republic of Texas was established in 1836 in the aftermath of a rebellion against Mexican authority. Texas annexation to the U.S. was resisted by Northerners opposed to the expansion of slavery. But during the Polk Administration, Texas was annexed as a slave state. This led directly to the Mexican–American War as Mexico moved to protect its territorial claims from American expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Trotter, Gordon T., “100th Anniversary of Texas Statehood Issue”, Arago: people, postage &amp; the post, National Postal Museum online.

==Early history==
===Origins of federal food and drug regulation===
Up until the 20th century, there were few federal laws regulating the contents and sale of domestically produced food and pharmaceuticals, with one exception being the short-lived [[Vaccine Act of 1813]]. A patchwork of state laws provided varying degrees of protection against unethical sales practices, such as misrepresenting the ingredients of food products or therapeutic substances. The history of the FDA can be traced to the latter part of the 19th century and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's [[Division of Chemistry]] (later Bureau of Chemistry). Under [[Harvey Washington Wiley]], appointed chief chemist in 1883, the Division began conducting research into the adulteration and misbranding of food and drugs on the American market. Although they had no regulatory powers, the Division published its findings from 1887 to 1902 in a ten-part series entitled ''Foods and Food Adulterants''. Wiley used these findings, and alliances with diverse organizations such as state regulators, the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]], and national associations of [[physicians]] and [[pharmacists]], to lobby for a new federal law to set uniform standards for food and drugs to enter into [[interstate commerce]]. Wiley's advocacy came at a time when the public had become aroused to hazards in the marketplace by [[muckraker|muckraking]] journalists like [[Upton Sinclair]], and became part of a general trend for increased federal regulations in matters pertinent to public safety during the [[Progressive Era]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FDAHist&quot;&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/Origin/ucm054819.htm A History of the FDA]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1902 [[Biologics Control Act]] was put in place after [[diphtheria]] antitoxin was collected from a [[Jim (horse)|horse named Jim]] who contracted tetanus, resulting in several deaths.
Much credit is given to the deaths of many people in the 1930s, including [[Eben Byers]] in 1932 from the [[ingestion]] of [[radithor]] and many women, some known as [[The Radium Girls]], to making the FDA into the much more powerful organization we know today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cult of Weird 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Radioactive Death of Eben  Byers|url=http://www.cultofweird.com/medical/eben-byers-radithor-poisoning/|work=Medical Curiosities|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cult of Weird 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Curiosities|url=http://www.cultofweird.com/medical/radium-girls/|work=The Radium Girls|publisher=/|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radithor Radioactive Health Water!|url=http://esmeraldasquietlife.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/radithor-radioactive-health-water/|publisher=Esmeralda's Quiet Life|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Medicine: Radium Drinks|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743525,00.html|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=26 March 2012|date=11 April 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1906 Food and Drug Act and creation of the FDA===
In June 1906, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] signed into law the [[Pure Food and Drug Act|Food and Drug Act]], also known as the &quot;Wiley Act&quot; after its chief advocate.&lt;ref name=&quot;FDAHist&quot;/&gt; The Act prohibited, under penalty of seizure of goods, the interstate transport of food which had been &quot;adulterated,&quot; with that term referring to the addition of fillers of reduced &quot;quality or strength,&quot; coloring to conceal &quot;damage or inferiority,&quot; formulation with additives &quot;injurious to health,&quot; or the use of &quot;filthy, decomposed, or putrid&quot; substances. The act applied similar penalties to the interstate marketing of &quot;adulterated&quot; drugs, in which the &quot;standard of strength, quality, or purity&quot; of the active ingredient was not either stated clearly on the label or listed in the ''[[United States Pharmacopoeia]]'' or the ''[[National Formulary]]''. The act also banned &quot;misbranding&quot; of food and drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/wileyact.htm Original Text of the 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Amendments]&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibility for examining food and drugs for such &quot;adulteration&quot; or &quot;misbranding&quot; was given to Wiley's USDA Bureau of Chemistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;FDAHist&quot;/&gt;

Wiley used these new regulatory powers to pursue an aggressive campaign against the manufacturers of foods with chemical additives, but the Chemistry Bureau's authority was soon checked by judicial decisions, as well as by the creation of the Board of Food and Drug Inspection and the Referee Board of Consulting Scientific Experts as separate organizations within the USDA in 1907 and 1908 respectively. A 1911 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision ruled that the 1906 act did not apply to false claims of therapeutic efficacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= United States v. Johnson (1911) |vol= 221 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=488 |pinpoint= |court=31 S.

This name was shortened to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) three years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot;&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/miles.html Milestones in U.S. Food and Drug Law History]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act===
By the 1930s, muckraking journalists, consumer protection organizations, and federal regulators began mounting a campaign for stronger regulatory authority by publicizing a list of injurious products which had been ruled permissible under the 1906 law, including [[radioactive]] [[Radithor|beverages]], the [[mascara]] Lash lure, which caused blindness, and worthless &quot;cures&quot; for [[diabetes]] and [[tuberculosis]]. The resulting proposed law was unable to get through the [[Congress of the United States]] for five years, but was rapidly enacted into law following the public outcry over the 1937 [[Elixir sulfanilamide|Elixir Sulfanilamide]] tragedy, in which over 100 people died after using a drug formulated with a toxic, untested solvent.  The only way that the FDA could even seize the product was due to a misbranding problem: an &quot;Elixir&quot; was defined as a medication dissolved in [[ethanol]], not the [[diethylene glycol]] used in the [[Elixir sulfanilamide|Elixir Sulfanilamide]]. Had it been labeled a &quot;solution&quot; instead, it is argued, the agency could have done nothing to track down and confiscate what medication remained in the public's hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamowy|first=Ronald|title=Medical Disasters and the Growth of FDA|date=February 2010|pages=7|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/policy_reports/2010-02-10-fda.pdf|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] signed the new [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] (FD&amp;C Act) into law on June 24, 1938. The new law significantly increased federal regulatory authority over drugs by mandating a pre-market review of the safety of all new drugs, as well as banning false therapeutic claims in drug labeling without requiring that the FDA prove fraudulent intent. The law also authorized factory inspections and expanded enforcement powers, set new regulatory standards for foods, and brought cosmetics and therapeutic devices under federal regulatory authority. This law, though extensively amended in subsequent years, remains the central foundation of FDA regulatory authority to the present day.&lt;ref name=&quot;FDAHist&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of human drugs and medical devices after 1938==

===Early FD&amp;C Act amendments: 1938–1958===
Soon after passage of the 1938 Act, the FDA began to designate certain drugs as safe for use only under the supervision of a medical professional, and the category of &quot;[[Prescription drug|prescription-only]]&quot; drugs was securely codified into law by the 1951 [[Durham-Humphrey Amendment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FDAHist&quot;/&gt; While pre-market testing of drug efficacy was not authorized under the 1938 FD&amp;C Act, subsequent amendments such as the [[Insulin Amendment]] and [[Penicillin Amendment]] did mandate potency testing for formulations of specific lifesaving pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot;/&gt; The FDA began enforcing its new powers against drug manufacturers who could not substantiate the efficacy claims made for their drugs, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruling in ''Alberty Food Products Co. v. United States'' (1950) found that drug manufacturers could not evade the &quot;false therapeutic claims&quot; provision of the 1938 act by simply omitting the intended use of a drug from the drug's label. These developments confirmed extensive powers for the FDA to enforce post-marketing recalls of ineffective drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;FDAHist&quot;/&gt; Much of the FDA's regulatory attentions in this era were directed towards abuse of amphetamines and barbiturates, but the agency also reviewed some 13,000 new drug applications between 1938 and 1962. While the science of [[toxicology]] was in its infancy at the start of this era, rapid advances in experimental assays for food additive and drug safety testing were made during this period by FDA regulators and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;FDAHist&quot;/&gt;

===Expansion of premarket approval process: 1959–1985===
In 1959, Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] began holding congressional hearings into concerns about pharmaceutical industry practices, such as the perceived high cost and uncertain efficacy of many drugs promoted by manufacturers. There was significant opposition, however, to calls for a new law expanding the FDA's authority. This climate was rapidly changed by the [[thalidomide]] tragedy, in which thousands of European babies were born deformed after their mothers took that drug - marketed for treatment of nausea - during their pregnancies. Thalidomide had not been approved for use in the U.S. due to the concerns of an FDA reviewer, [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]], about thyroid toxicity. However, thousands of &quot;trial samples&quot; had been sent to American doctors during the &quot;clinical investigation&quot; phase of the drug's development, which at the time was entirely unregulated by the FDA. Individual members of Congress cited the thalidomide incident in lending their support to expansion of FDA authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/udall/congrept/87th/620817.html Report of Congressman Morris Udall on thalidomide and the Kefauver hearings].&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1962 [[Kefauver-Harris Amendment]] to the FD&amp;C act represented a &quot;revolution&quot; in FDA regulatory authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Temple R |year=2002 |title=Policy developments in regulatory approval |journal=Statistics in Medicine|pmid=12325110 |volume=21|issue=19 |pages=2939–2948 |doi=10.1002/sim.1298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important change was the requirement that all new drug applications demonstrate &quot;substantial evidence&quot; of the drug's efficacy for a marketed indication, in addition to the existing requirement for pre-marketing demonstration of safety. This marked the start of the FDA approval process in its modern form. Drugs approved between 1938 and 1962 were also subject to FDA review of their efficacy, and to potential withdrawal from the market. Other important provisions of the 1962 amendments included the requirement that drug companies use the &quot;established&quot; or &quot;generic&quot; name of a drug along with the trade name, the restriction of drug advertising to FDA-approved indications, and expansion of FDA powers to inspect drug manufacturing facilities.

These reforms had the effect of increasing the time required to bring a drug to market.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 180&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|coauthors= |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 180|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1970s, 13 of the 14 drugs the FDA saw as most important to approve were on the market in other countries before the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 180&quot;/&gt;

One of the most important statutes in establishing the modern American pharmaceutical market was the 1984 [[Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act]], more commonly known as the &quot;Hatch-Waxman Act&quot; after its chief sponsors. This act was intended to correct two unfortunate interactions between the new regulations mandated by the 1962 amendments, and existing [[patent]] law (which is not regulated or enforced by the FDA, but rather by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]). Because the additional clinical trials mandated by the 1962 amendments significantly delayed the marketing of new drugs, without extending the duration of the manufacturer's patent, &quot;pioneer&quot; drug manufacturers experienced a decreased period of lucrative market exclusivity. On the other hand, the new regulations could be interpreted to require complete safety and efficacy testing for [[generic drug|generic]] copies of approved drugs, and &quot;pioneer&quot; manufacturers obtained court decisions which prevented generic manufacturers from even beginning the clinical trial process while a drug was still under patent. The Hatch-Waxman Act was intended as a compromise between the &quot;pioneer&quot; and generic drug manufacturers which would reduce the overall cost of bringing generics to market and thus, it was hoped, reduce the long-term price of the drug, while preserving the overall profitability of developing new drugs.

The act extended the patent exclusivity terms of new drugs, and importantly tied those extensions, in part, to the length of the FDA approval process for each individual drug. For generic manufacturers, the Act created a new approval mechanism, the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), in which the generic drug manufacturer need only demonstrate that their generic formulation has the same active ingredient, route of administration, dosage form, strength, and [[pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] properties (&quot;bioequivalence&quot;) as the corresponding brand-name drug. This act has been credited with essentially creating the modern generic drug industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;HatchWaxman&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Karki L |year=2005 |title=Review of FDA Law Related to Pharmaceuticals: The Hatch-Waxman Act, Regulatory Amendments and Implications for Drug Patent Enforcement |journal=Journal of the Patent &amp; Trademark Office Society |volume=87 |pages=602–620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FDA reforms in the AIDS era===
Concerns about the length of the drug approval process were brought to the fore early in the [[AIDS]] epidemic. In the mid- and late 1980s, [[ACT-UP]] and other [[HIV]] activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and opportunistic infections, and staged large protests, such as a confrontational October 11, 1988 action at the FDA campus which resulted in nearly 180 arrests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actupny.org/documents/cron-88.html ACT-UP NY timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1990, [[Louis Lasagna|Dr. Louis Lasagna]], then chairman of a presidential advisory panel on drug approval, estimated that thousands of lives were lost each year due to delays in approval and marketing of drugs for cancer and AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;Faster Approval of AIDS Drugs Is Urged, The New York Times, August 16, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition – Final, Section B; Page 12, Column 4; National Desk, 830 words, By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times, Washington, Aug. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA issued new rules to expedite approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases, and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/expanded.html FDA Website: Expanded Access and Expedited Approval of New Therapies Related to HIV/AIDS]&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these new rules was the &quot;IND exemption&quot; or &quot;treatment IND&quot; rule, which allowed expanded access to a drug undergoing phase II or III trials (or in extraordinary cases even earlier) if it potentially represented a safer or better alternative to treatments currently available for terminal or serious illness. A second new rule, the &quot;parallel track policy&quot;, allowed a drug company to set up a mechanism for access to a new potentially lifesaving drug by patients who for various reasons would be unable to participate in ongoing clinical trials. The &quot;parallel track&quot; designation could be made at the time of IND submission. The accelerated approval rules were further expanded and codified in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Orlando V  |year=1999 |title=The FDA's Accelerated Approval Process: Does the Pharmaceutical Industry Have Adequate Incentives for Self-Regulation? |journal=American Journal of Law and Medicine |volume=25|issue=4 |pages=543–68|pmid=10629734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the initial drugs approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS were approved through accelerated approval mechanisms. For example, a &quot;treatment IND&quot; was issued for the first HIV drug, [[Zidovudine|AZT]], in 1985, and approval was granted just two years later in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/fdac/special/newdrug/speeding.html FDA report on accelerated approval process]&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the first five drugs targeting HIV were approved in the United States before they were approved in any other country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Challenges to FDA authority by states===
In two instances, state governments have sought to legalize drugs which have not been approved by the FDA. Because federal law passed pursuant to Constitutional authority overrules conflicting state laws,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} federal authorities still claim the authority to seize, arrest, and prosecute for possession and sales of these substances, even in states where they are legal under state law.

The first wave was the legalization by 27 states of [[laetrile]] in the late 1970s. This drug was used as a treatment for cancer, but scientific studies both before and after this legislative trend found it to be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=127773447 NPR.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;quack-laetrile&quot;&gt;[http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/laetrile.html Quackwatch.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Federal law enforcement prevented interstate shipment, making the drug infeasible to manufacture and sell.  Further studies based on a Mexican formulation also showed no effectiveness in treating cancer, but did find that some patients experienced symptoms of [[cyanide poisoning]]. Though the political movement died out in the 1980s, FDA enforcement actions against laetrile purveyors continued into the 2000s.&lt;ref name=&quot;quack-laetrile&quot; /&gt;

The second wave concerned [[medical marijuana]] in the 1990s and 2000s. Though Virginia passed a law with limited effect in 1979, a more widespread trend began in California in 1996. In 2009, the Obama Administration de-prioritized enforcement of federal law against patients using the drug in compliance with state law, but reversed this policy in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/medical-marijuana-meets-hostility-from-obama-administration/2012/05/04/gIQA80GK2T_story.html|title= Medical marijuana meets hostility from Obama administration|date=4 May 2012|accessdate=24 June 2012|first=Rob|last=Kampia|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recreational marijuana remains illegal (but not necessarily criminal) in all states and at the federal level, as of 2009.

===Regulation of living organisms===
With acceptance of premarket notification 510(k) k033391 in January 2004, the FDA granted Dr. Ronald Sherman permission to produce and market [[medical maggots]] for use in humans or other animals as a prescription medical device.
[[Medical maggots]] represent the first living organism allowed by the Food and Drug Administration for production and marketing as a prescription medical device.

In June 2004, the FDA cleared ''[[Hirudo medicinalis]]'' (medicinal leeches) as the second living organism to be used as a medical devices.

==Timeline of food and drug legislation==
Most federal laws concerning the FDA are part of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/fdcact/fdctoc.htm Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act Web Version]&lt;/ref&gt; (first passed in 1938 and extensively amended since) and are codified in [[Title 21 of the United States Code|Title 21, Chapter 9 of the United States Code]]. Other significant laws enforced by the FDA include the [[Public Health Service Act]], parts of the [[Controlled Substances Act]], the [[Federal Anti-Tampering Act]], as well as many others. In many cases these responsibilities are shared with other federal agencies.

Since 1872 the United States [[National Park System]] has grown from a single, public reservation called [[Yellowstone National Park]] to embrace over 450 natural, historical, recreational, and cultural areas throughout the United States, its territories, and island possessions. These areas include a diverse varieties of areas —[[National Parks]], [[U.S. National Monument|National Monuments]], [[National Memorial]]s, [[National Military Park]]s, [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Sites]], [[National Parkway]]s, [[National Recreation Area]]s, [[National Seashore]]s, [[National Wild and Scenic River|National Scenic Riverways]], [[National Scenic Trail]]s, and others.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee, Ronald F.; Family Tree of the National Park System, A Chart with Accompanying Text Designed to Illustrate the Growth of the National Park System 1872-1972; 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==

===National Parks 1864-1891===
[[File:Half Dome Yosemite National Park Painting.jpg|Thumb|250 px|left|Half Dome by Gunnar Widfoss(1922)]]The national park idea has been credited to the artist [[George Catlin]]. In 1832 he traveled the northern [[Great Plains]] of the United States, where he became concerned about the destruction of the Indian civilization, wildlife, and wilderness as eastern settlements spread westward. He wrote, “by some great protecting policy of government... in a magnificent park... a nation’s park, containing man and beast, in all the wild[ness] and freshness of their nature’s beauty!” &lt;ref name=Shaping&gt;The National Parks: Shaping the System; Harpers Ferry Center; U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Catlin’s vision had no immediate effect. In the east, romantic portrayals of nature by [[James Fenimore Cooper]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] and painters [[Thomas Cole]] and [[Frederick Edwin Church]] began to compete with prevailing view of wilderness as a challenge to overcome. Slowly unspoiled nature and spectacular natural areas of the West became better known, the idea of saving such places became of interest.

In California, several state leaders sought to protect [[Yosemite Valley]]. In 1864, Sen. [[John Conness]] of [[California]] sponsored an act to transfer the valley and nearby [[Mariposa Grove|Mariposa Big Tree Grove]] to the state so they might “be used and preserved for the benefit of mankind”. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed this act of [[United States Congress|Congress]] on June 30, 1864. California was granted the valley and the grove on condition that They would “be held for public use, resort, and recreation...inalienable for all time.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaping &quot; /&gt;

The [[Yellowstone National Park#Park creation and later history|Yellowstone]] country was first &quot;officially&quot; explored by [[Cook–Folsom–Peterson Expedition|David E. Folsom]], [[Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition|Henry D. Washburn]], and [[Hayden Geological Survey of 1871|Ferdinand Hayden]] in 1869-71. A myth evolved that near the end of the Washburn expedition, discussion around the campfire led several of the members to suggest that the area be set aside for public use and not allow it to be sold to private individuals. This myth was successfully exploited by National Park advocates but eventually was debunked by historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schullery |first=Paul |title=Myth and History in the Creation of Yellowstone National Park |author2=Whittlesey, Lee |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, NE |year=2003 |isbn=0-8032-4305-7 |pages=30–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An early ally in promoting a public reservation was the [[Northern Pacific Railroad Company]]. They were seeking major destinations for their route through Montana.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaping &quot; /&gt; In an effort to reduce poaching and other misuse of the park, the U.S. Army established a fort in the area in 1881 and began park protection, establishing a pattern that would be continued by later park rangers.

In 1875, [[Mackinac National Park]] was created on a resort island in Lake Huron in Michigan, the second national park. As at Yellowstone, the army garrison at [[Fort Mackinac]] were in charge of supervising and improving the park. The fort and the national park were turned over to state control in 1895.

U.S. cavalry units took up a position in California-controlled Yosemite Park in 1891 and took over some management duties. In 1906 the park was completely taken into federal control.

===National Monument line I, 1906-1916===
While early emphasis had been on the creation of [[National Parks]], there was another movement seeking to preserve the cliff dwellings, pueblo ruins, and early missions throughout the west and southwest. Often local ranchers would try to protect these ruins from plunder, but pot-hunters vandalized many sites. The effort began in Boston and spread to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Denver]], and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], during the 1880s and 1890s. Rep. [[John Fletcher Lacey]] of [[Iowa]] and Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] of [[Massachusetts]], created the [[Antiquities Act of 1906]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;[[File:Devils Tower from west.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Devils Tower's westwall is a {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}} vertical climb]]

The [[Antiquities Act of 1906]] was designed to protect antiquities and objects of scientific interest on the public domain. It authorized the [[President of the United States|President]], &quot;to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest&quot; that existed on public lands in the United States. The Act declared these sites to be National Monuments. It prohibited the excavation or removal of objects on Federal land unless a permit had been issued by the appropriate department.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt; Between 1906 and 1933 three Federal agencies, the Departments of [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior]], [[United States Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of Defense|War]], initiated and administered separate groups of [[National Monument (United States)|National Monument]]s.

President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] signed the Antiquities Act on June 8, 1906. As early as 1889 Congress authorized the President to reserve the land on which the well known [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruin]] was located. In 1904, Dr. [[Edgar Lee Hewett]] made a review of all the Indian ruins on Federal lands in [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], and [[Utah]]. He recommended many sites for protection. Based on Hewett’s report and many individual request and reports from throughout the west, between 1906 and 1916 the Interior Department recommended and Presidents Roosevelt, [[William Howard Taft]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]] proclaimed twenty National Monuments&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

On September 24, 1906 President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed [[Devils Tower National Monument|Devils Tower]] as the first National Monument. Devils Tower is a Wyoming landmark, a {{convert|600|ft|m|adj=on}} high tower of rock, visible for nearly {{convert|100|mi|km}}. It has been a guidepost and a religious site. In December of that year, three more National Monuments were created. [[El Morro National Monument|El Morro]], [[New Mexico]] is a wayside in the rugged desert lands used by Indians settlers and travelers for centuries as a watering hole and a place to leave their marks. The site includes prehistoric [[petroglyphs]] and hundreds of inscriptions from 17th century Spanish explorers and 19th century American emigrants and settlers. [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]], [[Arizona]], is one of the best preserved cliff dwellings. [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]], Arizona, is world-renowned for its petrified wood, Indian ruins and petroglyphs. Three of these original National Monuments later became the core of National Parks. Mukuntuweap became [[Zion National Park|Zion]], Sieur de Monts grew into [[Acadia National Park|Acadia]], and Petrified Forest which was expanded by Congress to become a National Park of the same name. Three of the smaller areas were later abolished, those being [[Lewis and Clark Caverns]], Shoshone Cavern, and [[Papago Park|Papago Saguaro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

===Mineral Springs line, 1832-1916===
[[File:Quapaw Baths HABS 1984.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Quapaw Baths from HABS image]]Mineral springs have been used for their medicinal properties since ancient times. By 1800, places like [[Saratoga Springs]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Berkeley Springs]] and [[White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia|White Sulphur Springs]], [[West Virginia]], and [[French Lick]], [[Indiana]], were becoming popular American resorts. In 1832 [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], was set aside as a Federal reservation to protect 47 hot springs. In 1870 the area was protected by Congress as the [[Hot Springs Reservation]] and in 1921 it was made a National Park. [[Hot Springs National Park]] is a health resort and spa rather than a scenic area.

In 1902 the Federal Government purchased 32 mineral springs near [[Sulphur, Oklahoma]], from the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]] Indians. The Sulphur Springs Reservation was placed under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior who shortly acquired some additional land. In 1906 Congress created [[Platt National Park]] which included the Sulphur Springs Reservation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

==Establishment, 1916==
Forty-four years after the establishment of [[Yellowstone]], President [[Woodrow Wilson]] created the [[National Park Service]] on August 25, 1916. For years [[J. Horace McFarland]], President of the [[American Civic Association]]; Secretaries of the Interior [[Walter L. Fisher|Walter Fisher]] and [[Franklin K. Lane]]; Presidents [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]]; [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr]].; Representatives [[William Kent (U.S. Congressman)|William Kent]] and [[John E. Raker]] of California; Senator [[Reed Smoot]] of Utah; [[Stephen T. Mather]] and [[Horace M. Albright]] had been seeking the creation of separate agency to manage the National Parks and Monuments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

==Reorganization of 1933==
On June 10, 1933, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed Executive Order 6166 which consolidated all National Parks and National Monuments, National Military Parks, the eleven National Cemeteries, National Memorials, and the National Capital Parks into a single National Park System. The National Park Service was directed to oversee all of these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Horace M. Albright, Origins of National Park Service Administration of Historic Sites, [[Eastern National Park and Monument Association]], 1971&lt;/ref&gt;
There were three significant results of this action:
# it made the National Park Service the sole Federal agency responsible for all Federally owned public parks, monuments, and memorials;
# it enlarged the National Park System idea to include at least four types of areas not clearly included in the System concept before 1933 — [[National Memorials]], like the [[Washington Monument]] and the [[Statue of Liberty]]; [[National Military Park]]s, like [[Gettysburg National Military Park|Gettysburg]] and [[Antietam National Battlefield|Antietam]] with their adjoining [[United States National Cemetery|National Cemeteries]]; [[National Capital Parks]], a great urban park system as old as the nation itself; and the first recreational area — [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]];
# the reorganization substantially increased the number of areas in the System by adding 12 natural areas in 9 western states and [[Alaska]] and 57 historical areas located in 17 predominantly eastern states and the [[District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

===National Capital Parks line, 1790-1933===
[[File:The Mall in WDC.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|The Mall]]National Capital Parks are the oldest parks in the National Park System. These parks began with the founding of the [[District of Columbia]] in 1790. The President appointed three Federal Commissioners to design a district ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) square on the Potomac River for the permanent seat of the Federal Government. The current National Capital Parks office is a direct lineal descendant of the original office established by the first commissioners of the District of Columbia in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius W. Heine, A History of National Capital Parks (Washington: National Park Service, 1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[George Washington]] engaged Major [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] to design the new capital city. The [[Washington D.C.#Cityscape|L'Enfant Plan]] proposed a city of beauty. The plan was designed around a series of boulevards, parks and [[National Mall|The Mall]]. Additionally, L'Enfant envisaged a Congress Garden and a President's Park; embellished with statues, columns, or obelisks; grand fountains; an equestrian statue of Washington; a Naval Column; and a zero milestone.

[[Rock Creek Park]] was authorized on September 27, 1890, two days after [[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]] and three days before [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]]. Congress carried over some of the language of the [[Yellowstone Act]] into all three acts. Like Yellowstone, [[Rock Creek Park]] was &quot;dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of the United States,&quot; where all timber, animals, and curiosities were to be retained &quot;in their natural condition, as nearly as possible.&quot; Though not a ‘National Park’, Rock Creek Park is a major urban park of the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

===National Memorials line, 1776-1933===
[[File:WashingtonMonumentTidalBasin.JPG|thumb|300 px|left|Washington Monument]]The first memorial was authorized by the [[Continental Congress]] on January 25, 1776, to honor General [[Richard Montgomery]], killed during an assault on the heights of [[Quebec]] in the midst of a snowstorm on the night of December 31, 1775. Montgomery commanded New York troops sent a few months before on an expedition designed to win Canada to the Revolutionary cause. It failed before Quebec, and Montgomery, became one of the first Revolutionary generals to lose his life on the field of battle. The Montgomery Memorial is not a part of the National Park System. But the chapel where it is located, St. Paul's Chapel, is a [[National Historic Landmark]].

The Continental Congress climaxed its commemorative actions in August 1783 by resolving &quot;that an equestrian statue of General Washington be erected where the residence of Congress shall be established.&quot; The equestrian statue of Washington is executed by Clark Mills, placed in [[Washington Circle]] on [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]], and dedicated in 1859.

When the centennial of Washington's birth came in 1832 with no satisfactory monument to in the National Capital, [[George Watterston]], [[Librarian of Congress]], and other civic leaders organized the [[Washington Monument]] Society, to erect an appropriate monument from private subscriptions. In 1848 Congress transferred a site on the Mall to the Society, and the cornerstone of the Washington Monument was laid on July 4. Slow progress was made worse by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. When the nation's first centennial came around in 1876 the Washington Monument was only a third completed. The [[United States Congress]] passed legislation authorizing the transfer of the Monument and site to the United States for completion and maintenance as a National Memorial. The Washington Monument was dedicated on February 21, 1885.

In 1933 these National Memorials were added to the [[National Park System]] and the National Memorial function assigned to the National Park Service, except [[Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial|Perry's Victory Memorial]], which was administered by a commission until it was added to the System in 1936. Also, the fiscal functions of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Commission were assigned to the [[National Park Service]] in 1933 and the Memorial itself in 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

===National Military Parks line, 1781-1933===
[[File:Cowpens225-2.JPG|thumb|left|300 px|Battle of Cowpens Reenactment, 225th anniversary, January 14, 2006]]The National Military Park line, including early battlefield monuments, began in 1781. Between 1890 and 1933 the War Department developed it into a National Military Park System. In 1933, there were twenty areas, 11-National Military Parks and 9-National Battlefield Sites.

The line started on October 29, 1781 when the [[Continental Congress]] authorized the first official on-site battlefield monument. It resolved: &quot;That the United States in Congress assembled, will cause to be erected at York, in Virginia, a marble column, adorned with emblems of the alliance between the United States and His Most Christian Majesty; and inscribed with a succinct narrative of the surrender....&quot;

In 1823 in [[Boston]]; [[Daniel Webster]], [[Edward Everett]], and other prominent citizens formed the Bunker Hill Battle Monument Association to save part of the historic field and erect on it a great commemorative monument. The cornerstone was laid on June 17, 1825. During the Revolutionary Centennial years, 1876–83, Congress appropriated federal funds to match local funds for Revolutionary battle monuments, and through this means imposing monuments were erected at [[Bennington Battlefield State Historic Site|Bennington Battlefield]], Vermont; [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]], [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], and [[Battle of Oriskany|Oriskany]], New York; [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]], South Carolina; [[Battle of Monmouth|Monmouth]], New Jersey; and [[Battle of Groton Heights|Groton]], Connecticut. Of these, Cowpens is now a unit in the National Park System, and Bunker Hill, Bennington, Oriskany, and Monmouth are [[National Historic Landmarks]].

April 30, 1864, in the midst of the Civil War, [[Pennsylvania]] chartered the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]] Memorial Association to commemorate &quot;the great deeds of valor... and the signal events which render these battlegrounds illustrious.&quot; This association was among the earliest historic preservation organizations in the country. By 1890 it had acquired several hundred acres of land on the battlefield including areas in the vicinity of Spangler's Spring, the Wheatfield, Little Round Top, and the Peach Orchard as well as the small white frame house General Meade had used as headquarters.

With interest and support from both North and South Congress decided to go beyond the former battlefield monument concept to authorize the first four National Military Parks — [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park|Chickamauga &amp; Chattanooga]] in 1890, [[Shiloh National Military Park|Shiloh]] in 1894, [[Gettysburg Battlefield|Gettysburg]] in 1895, and [[Vicksburg National Military Park|Vicksburg]] in 1899. These areas were not selected at random but constituted, almost from the beginning, a rational system, designed to preserve major battlefields for historical and professional study and as lasting memorials to the great armies of both sides.

The National Military Park System was approaching maturity under the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in 1933 when all these battlefields were transferred to the National Park Service to become a significant and unique element in the National Park System.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;
All of the exhibits are permanent,and will always be shown in the museum.

===National Cemetery line, 1867-1933===
[[File:Gettysburg national cemetery img 4164.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Gettysburg National Cemetery]]The [[United States National Cemetery|National Cemeteries]] in the National Park System are closely related to the National Military Parks. The [[battle of Gettysburg]] was scarcely over when Governor Andrew Y. Curtin ([[Pennsylvania]]) hastened to the field to assist local residents in caring for the dead or dying. More than 6,000 soldiers had been killed in action, and among 21,000 wounded hundreds more died each day. Initially interred in improvised graves on the battlefield, Curtin approved plans for a Soldier's National Cemetery.

[[William Saunders (botanist)|William Saunders]] planned [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]]. He enclosed it with a massive stone wall, the lawns were framed by trees and shrubs. The graves were laid out in a great semicircle, state by state, around the site for a sculptured central feature, a Soldier's National Monument. The Soldier's National Cemetery, as it was then called, was dedicated by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on November 19, 1863. The speaker's platform occupied the site set aside for the Soldier's National Monument, then awaiting future design. The immortal words of Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] gave this spot a historical and patriotic association. [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]] became the honored property of the nation on May 1, 1872, now a century ago.

Congress recognized the importance of honoring and caring for the remains of the war dead by enacting general legislation in 1867 which provided for a system of National Cemeteries developed by the War Department. Eleven of the National Cemeteries established under that authority were added to the National Park System in 1933. The act of 1867 also provided authority for preserving an important battlefield of the Indian wars when, on January 29, 1879, the Secretary of War designated &quot;The National Cemetery of Custer's Battlefield Reservation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

===National Monument line II, 1910-1933; War Department===
The [[Antiquities Act of 1906]] authorized the President to proclaim National Monuments not only on western public lands but on any lands owned or controlled by the United States. Between 1906 and 1933 successive Presidents proclaimed ten National Monuments on military reservations;

The authority to proclaim National Monuments on military reservations is still valid, no others have been proclaimed. Instead, historic but obsolete fortifications are declared surplus by the [[United States Department of Defense]] and transferred to the National Park Service, the States, or other political subdivisions following Congressional authorization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

===National Monument line III, 1907-1933; Department of Agriculture===
Between 1907 and 1933, six presidents proclaimed 21 National Monuments on [[United States National Forests|National Forest]] lands administered by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]:
[[File:SUCR2262.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Sunset Crater, cinder cone]]

* [[Bryce Canyon National Park|Bryce Canyon]], Utah
* [[Chiricahua National Monument|Chiricahua]], Ariz.
* [[Mount of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]], Colo. (abolished Aug. 3, 1950)
* [[Sunset Crater]], Ariz.
* [[Saguaro National Monument|Saguaro]], Ariz.

The first two National Monuments in the Department of Agriculture were Lassen Peak and Cinder Cone, created within [[Lassen Peak National Forest]], [[California]], on May 6, 1907, to preserve evidence of what was then the most recent volcanic activity in the United States south of Alaska. In 1916 these two monuments formed the nucleus for [[Lassen Volcanic National Park]].

Fourteen of the other Department of Agriculture National Monuments were established to preserve &quot;scientific objects&quot;. Moved by a report of plans to build an electric railway along its rim, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] proclaimed [[Grand Canyon National Monument]] on lands within the [[Grand Canyon National Forest]], [[Arizona]], on January 11, 1908. In 1919 the National Monument became the nucleus of [[Grand Canyon National Park]].

[[File:2000-09-23 GracieByDownedCyprus.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Downed Western Red Cedar]]Two days before leaving office, on March 2, 1909, Roosevelt proclaimed Mount Olympus National Monument, from lands in the [[Olympic National Forest]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. It was established to protect the [[Olympic elk]] and important stands of [[Sitka spruce]], [[western hemlock]], [[Douglas-fir]], and [[Alaska cedar]] and [[Thuja plicata|redcedar]]. It formed the nucleus for [[Olympic National Park]] in 1938.

The authority to proclaim National Monuments on [[United States National Forest|National Forest]] lands is still valid, only two others have been created between the Reorganization of 1933 and 1974. Both were placed under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service, [[Cedar Breaks]], Utah, (August 22, 1933), and Jackson Hole, Wyoming, (March 13, 1943).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

==Growth, 1933-1966==
[[File:FDR in 1933.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 1933]]The long period between 1933 and 1964, began with the need to assimilate 71 diverse areas into the System. Among many other measures in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt instituted a broad program of natural resource conservation implemented in large part through the newly created [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. At the program's peak in 1935, the Service had 600 CCC camps, 118 of them assigned to National Park System areas and 482 to State Parks, employing approximately 120,000 enrollees and 6,000 professionally trained supervisors.

By mid-century, a great and growing backlog of deferred park maintenance and development projects, posed vast new problems for the Service and System. It was an era marked by the dramatic inauguration and prosecution of [[Mission 66]], the emergence of a national &quot;crisis in outdoor recreation,&quot; creation of the [[Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission]] and the [[Bureau of Outdoor Recreation]], and mounting national concern for better preservation of America's vanishing wilderness.

Between the Reorganization of 1933 and the Reorganization of 1964, 102 areas were added to the System as defined today, increasing the total number from 137 to 239 The distribution of the new areas among categories is significant. Of the new additions, 11 were &quot;Natural Areas&quot;, increasing their number from 58 to 69 or 19%. Seventy-five were &quot;Historical Areas&quot;, increasing their number from 77 to 152 or 96%. Fifteen were &quot;Recreation Areas&quot;, increasing their number from one to 16, or 1500%. It is clear that during this period the growth rate for Natural Areas noticeably diminished from previous levels and by comparison with the rate for other categories, even though very important additions of natural lands were still being made. On the other hand, the growth rates for Historical and Recreation Areas accelerated sharply. It took the Service a generation, from 1933 to 1964, to assimilate these 102 diverse new areas and the 71 areas added by the Reorganization of 1933 and incorporate them securely into one National Park System.

[[Jackson Hole, Wyoming|Jackson Hole]], had been talked of as a possible addition to [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] as early as 1892, and from 1916 onward the Service and [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] actively sought its preservation in the [[National Park System]]. It was [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], however, who rescued Jackson Hole. In 1926 he visited the area and discovered the cheap commercial development, on private lands, in the midst of superlative natural beauty. There were dance halls, hot dog stands, filling stations, rodeo grand stands, and billboards, blocking the view of the Teton Range.

[[File:Barns grand tetons.jpg|thumb|400 px|right|Grand Teton National Park]]Rockefeller began a land acquisition program. In a few years he held over {{convert|33000|acre|km2}} in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming|Jackson Hole]]. He offered these lands as a gift to the United States. Meanwhile, opposition developed among cattlemen, dude ranchers, packers, hunters, timber interests, and local Forest Service officials. By 1943, there was still no park legislation. Rockefeller indicated he might dispose of the property if no action was pending. On March 15, 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed the Jackson Hole National Monument, consolidating {{convert|33000|acre|km2}} donated by Rockefeller with {{convert|179000|acre|km2}} withdrawn from [[Teton National Forest]]. Thus, [[Grand Teton National Park]] was created.

President Roosevelt's proclamation unleashed a storm of criticism which had been brewing for years among western members of Congress. Rep. [[Frank A. Barrett]] of [[Wyoming]] and others introduced bills to abolish the monument and to repeal Section 2 of the [[Antiquities Act]] containing the President's authority to proclaim National Monuments. A bill to abolish the monument passed Congress in 1944 but was vetoed by President Roosevelt. The President noted in his veto that Presidents of both political parties, beginning with Theodore Roosevelt, had established ample precedents by proclaiming 82 National Monuments, seven of which were larger than Jackson Hole. The proclamation was nevertheless also contested in court, where it was strongly defended by the Departments of [[United States Department of Justice|Justice]] and [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior]] and upheld. A compromise was worked out and embodied in legislation approved by President [[Harry S Truman]] on September 14, 1950. It combined [[Jackson Hole National Monument]] and the old Grand Teton National Park in a &quot;new Grand Teton National Park&quot; containing some {{convert|298000|acre|km2}}, with special provisions regarding taxes and hunting. It also prohibited establishing or enlarging National Parks or Monuments in Wyoming in the future except by express authorization of Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

===Historical areas, 1933 - 1966===
[[File:Old North Bridge, Concord, Massachusetts, July 2005.JPG|thumb|300 px|right|Old North Bridge, [[Minute Man National Historical Park]] in [[Massachusetts]]]].
Seventy-five Historical Areas were added to the National Park System between 1933 and 1964, including nine National Historic Sites and one International Park in non-federal ownership. Areas represented nine historic themes: I. ''The Original Inhabitants'' (6); II. ''European Exploration &amp; Settlement'' (12): III. ''Development of the English Colonies'', 1700-1775 (2); IV. ''Major American Wars'' (10): V. ''Political and Military Affairs'' (16); VI. ''Westward Expansion'' 1763-1898 (15); VII ''America At Work'' (9): VIII ''The Contemplative Society'' (0); IX ''Society and Social Conscience'' (5).

Much of this would not have happened without the [[Historic Sites Act]] of 1935, a logical follow-up to the ''Reorganization of 1933''. On November 10, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited his friend and neighbor, Major Gist Blair, to give consideration &quot;to some kind of plan which would coordinate the broad relationship of the Federal Government to State and local interest in the maintenance of historic sources and places throughout the country.

The Act declared &quot;that it is a national policy to preserve for public use historic sites, buildings and objects of national significance for the inspiration and benefit of the people of the United States'.&quot; This new and greatly broadened national policy has been the cornerstone of the Federal Government's historic preservation program ever since 1935, reaffirmed both in the Act of October 26, 1949, which created the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], and in the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]]. To carry out the policy, the Act assigned broad powers, duties and functions to the Secretary of the Interior to be exercised through the National Park Service, among them:
# make a national survey of historic and archaeological sites, buildings, and objects to determine which have &quot;exceptional value as commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States;&quot;
# acquire real or personal property for the purpose of the Act;
# contract or make cooperative agreements with states, municipal subdivisions, corporations, associations, or individuals to preserve historic properties.
The Act established an Advisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings and Monuments.

]]Some of the most important historical additions to the System between 1933 and 1964 are almost lost to sight in this long thematic list. [[Jefferson National Expansion Memorial]] was the first National Historic Site established under authority of the Historic Sites Act. More important, its 37 square blocks embraced a key urban area on the historic St. Louis waterfront — the first major effort of the Service, after [[National Capital Parks]], to conserve and develop a large and important urban historic site. Some architectural monuments, including the Old St. Louis Post Office and the Cathedral, have been carefully preserved, but the main feature of the area is the only major national memorial of modern design in the United States, and one of a small number in the world — [[Eero Saarinen]]'s stainless steel Arch.

In 1948 Congress authorized another major urban project, the [[Independence National Historical Park]] in [[Philadelphia]], the most important historical area in the United States, embracing Independence Hall and Square, Congress Hall, Carpenters Hall, and many other sites and buildings associated with independence and the establishment of a government under the Constitution. The method of analyzing complex urban problems was used in Boston, where it led to authorization of [[Minute Man National Historical Park]] in 1959 and other sites, including the [[Bunker Hill Monument]], [[Faneuil Hall]], and the [[Old State House (Boston)|Old Boston State House]]. A commission was established for [[New York City]], where a complex of urban monuments were added, including [[Federal Hall]], [[Castle Clinton]], [[Grant Memorial]], [[Hamilton Grange]], [[Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site|Theodore Roosevelt's Birthplace]], and [[Sagamore Hill]] to the previously authorized [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]], whose boundaries were extended to include [[Ellis Island]].

The [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] was organized in 1933 upon the initiative of Mr. [[Charles E. Peterson]] of the [[National Park Service]] in cooperation with officials of the Library of Congress and the American Institute of Architects. Since 1933 the HABS has gathered more than 30,000 measured drawings, 40,000 photographs, and 13,000 pages of documentation for more than 13,000 of the Nation's historic buildings.

[[File:Ellis Island Hall Interior.JPG|thumb|300 px|right|[[New Jersey]]'s [[Ellis Island]], Main hall]].
The National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings was organized after passage of the Historic Sites Act in 1935. Beginning in 1960, the responsibilities of this Survey staff were extended to include recommendation of an important series of National Historic Landmarks, officially designated by the Secretary of the Interior. On October 9, 1960 Secretary of the Interior Fred A. Seaton announced the first official list of 92 historic sites and buildings eligible for designation as [[National Historic Landmarks]]. {{see also| National Register of Historic Places}}

The Inter-Agency Archaeological Salvage Program was organized by the National Park Service in 1946 at the request of the Committee for Recovery of Archaeological Remains to coordinate the salvage of irreplaceable pre-historic and historic Indian artifacts from projected reservoir sites in river valleys throughout the United States, before flooding. This program, which has been conducted for a quarter of a century in cooperation with the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and universities, museums, and research institutions throughout the country, has enormously deepened knowledge of American prehistory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

===Recreation areas, 1933 - 1966===
The Service responded to the emerging social and economic forces of the New Deal era, by expanding its cooperative relationships with the States, securing enactment of the comprehensive Park, Parkway and Recreation Area Study Act of 1936, and initiating four new types of Federal park areas — [[National Parkway]]s, [[National Recreation Area]]s, [[National Seashore]]s and [[Recreational Demonstration Area]]s. By the end of this period, fifteen of the over 50 such areas remained under the administration of the National Park Service. Because they had much in common, they were collectively designated Recreation Areas in the Reorganization of 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

The origin of Recreation Areas as a category in the National Park System stemmed in important part from widened responsibilities assigned to the Service beginning in the 1930s. A central feature of these new responsibilities was administration of hundreds of [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camps located in State Parks. The [[National Park Service]] had actively encouraged the state park movement ever since [[Stephen Tyng Mather]] helped organize the National Conference on State Parks at Des Moines, Iowa, in 1921. It was natural for the Service to be asked to assume national direction of [[s:Executive Order 7034|Emergency Conservation Work]] in state parks when that program was launched in 1933. Fortunately for the Service an exceptional administrator, [[Conrad L. Wirth]], was available to lead this complex nationwide program. It was a large and dynamic undertaking, at its peak involving administration of 482 CCC camps allotted to state parks employing almost 100,000 enrollees on work projects guided by a technical and professional staff numbering several thousand.

As this program got under way it became painfully evident that in the 1930s most states lacked any kind of comprehensive plans for state park systems. In 1941 the Service published its first comprehensive report, ''A Study of the Park and Recreation Problem in the United States'', a careful review of the whole problem of recreation and of national, state, county, and municipal parks in the United States. Interrupted by [[World War II]], Director Wirth arranged for these studies to be resumed with the inception of [[Mission 66]], and a second comprehensive report was published in 1964 entitled ''Parks for America, A Survey of Park and Related Resources in the Fifty States and a Preliminary Plan''. Numerous land planning studies of individual areas, river basins, and regions accompanied and supported these comprehensive reports. The four new types of Federal Recreation Areas added to the System between 1933 and 1964 were generally consistent with recommendations in these studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

===National Parkways===
[[File:Pinnacles 2.jpg|thumb|500 px|right|View from Pinnacles Overlook on Skyline Drive]]The modern parkway, fruit of the automobile age, appears to have its origins in the Westchester County Parkways, New York, built between 1913 and 1930. At first, Congress also applied the idea locally — in the District of Columbia — but later undertook projects more clearly national in scope. Congress authorized its first parkway project in 1913, the four-mile (6&amp;nbsp;km) Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, to connect Potomac Park with [[Rock Creek Park]] and the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoological Park]]. In 1928, Congress authorized the [[Mount Vernon Memorial Highway]] to link the District of Columbia with [[Mount Vernon]] in commemoration of the bicentennial of Washington's birth. In 1930 this highway was renamed the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]], and enlarged in concept to extend from Mount Vernon all the way to Great Falls in Virginia, and from Fort Washington to Great Falls in Maryland (Alexandria and the District of Columbia excepted).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

During World War II Congress extended the National Capital parkway network by authorizing the [[Suitland Parkway]] to provide an access road to Andrews Air Force Base, and the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]], whose initial unit provided access to Fort George G. Meade.

The [[Colonial Parkway]] in Virginia was the first authorized by Congress beyond the District of Columbia vicinity. It provided a landscaped {{convert|23|mi|km|adj=on}} roadway link between Jamestown Island, Colonial Williamsburg, and Yorktown Battlefield as part of Colonial National Monument, authorized in 1930.

A new era for National Parkways began with authorization of the Blue Ridge and Natchez Trace Parkways during the 1930s. These were not fairly short county or metropolitan parkways serving a variety of local and national traffic but protected recreational roadways traversing hundreds of miles of scenic and historic rural landscape. These different National Parkways started out as public works projects during the New Deal and were transformed into units of the National Park System.

[[File:Blueridgeparkwaylookingglassrock.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Blue Ridge Parkway across from Looking Glass Rock]]The [[Skyline Drive]] in [[Shenandoah National Park]] served as a prototype for the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]]. President Herbert Hoover conceived the idea of the Skyline Drive during vacations at his [[Rapidan Camp]]. It was planned in 1931 and begun as a relief project in 1932.

Following President Roosevelt's election Congress quickly enacted the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 to stimulate the economy. Among other provisions it authorized the Public Works Administrator, Secretary of the Interior [[Harold L. Ickes]], to prepare a comprehensive program of public works. Senator [[Harry F. Byrd]] of Virginia, aided by others, seized the opportunity to propose the construction of a scenic roadway linking [[Shenandoah National Park|Shenandoah]] and [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] as a public works project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

The [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] is considered by many to be a Service triumph in parkway design, providing the motorist with a serene environment conducive to leisurely travel and enjoyment while affording him many insights into the beauty, history, and culture of the Southern Highlands. The {{convert|469|mi|km|adj=on}} parkway, sometimes called a grand balcony, alternates sweeping views of mountain and valley with intimate glimpses of the fauna and flora of the Blue Ridge and close-up views of typical mountain structures, like Mabry's Mill, built of logs by pioneers and still operating.

The [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] is the second major National Parkway, a projected {{convert|450|mi|km|adj=on}} roadway through a protected zone of forest, meadow, and field which generally follows the route of the historic Natchez Trace from Nashville, Tennessee, to Natchez, Mississippi. The Old Natchez Trace was once an Indian path, then a wilderness road, and finally from 1800 to 1830 a highway binding the old Southwest to the Union. The parkway was completed in 2003 with the final link south of Nashville, Tennessee. The parkway links historic and natural features including Mount Locust, the earliest inn on the Trace, Emerald Mound, one of the largest Indian ceremonial structures in the United States, Chickasaw Village and Bynum Mounds in Mississippi, and Colbert's Ferry and Metal Ford in Tennessee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

===Recreational demonstration areas===
[[File:North valley trail pwfp.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|One of many small cascades on the North Valley Trail in Prince William Forest Park]]Like the Blue Ridge Parkway, two other Recreation Areas in today's National Park System trace their origin back to the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] of 1933 — [[Catoctin Mountain Park]], Maryland, and [[Prince William Forest Park]], Virginia.

Among many other features, the National Industrial Recovery Act authorized federal purchases of land considered submarginal for farming but valuable for recreation purposes. By 1936, 46 projects containing {{convert|397000|acre|km2}} had been set up in 24 different states, mostly near metropolitan centers, to provide outdoor recreation for people from crowded cities. It was intended from the beginning that most of these projects would be turned over to states and cities for operation and in 1942 Congress provided the necessary authority. By 1946 most of the conveyances had been completed. The National Park Service retained Catoctin Mountain Park, site of Camp David, but 4,500 of its acres were transferred to Maryland. Prince William Forest Park (formerly Chopawamsic) was retained as a unit administrated by National Capital Parks.

Some recreational demonstration lands were also added to Acadia, Shenandoah, White Sands, and Hopewell Village. Now largely forgotten, recreational demonstration projects left several permanent marks on the National Park System and illustrated again the ability of the Service to help meet changing social and economic conditions in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot; /&gt;

===Reservoir-related Recreation Areas===
[[File:Glen Canyon 305947975.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|The Colorado river winds through Glen Canyon in northern Arizona.]]Five National Recreation Areas were added to the System between 1933 and 1964. This new type of federal park area grew out of large scale reclamation projects like Hoover Dam and multi purpose river basin development programs like the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] which began in the 1930s and spread to river valleys in all parts of the country after World War II.

[[Lake Mead National Recreation Area|Lake Mead]] was the first National Recreation Area. The Boulder Canyon Project Act, passed in 1928, authorized the Bureau of Reclamation to construct Hoover Dam on the Colorado River. Work began in 1931 and the dam, highest in the Western Hemisphere, was completed in 1935. The next year, under provisions of an agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation, the National Park Service assumed responsibility for all recreational activities at Lake Mead.

Coulee Dam National Recreation Area (now called [[Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area]]) was established in 1946, under an agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation patterned after Lake Mead. Construction of Grand Coulee Dam began in 1933 and the dam went into operation in 1941. It impounds a huge body of water named Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, {{convert|151|mi|km}} long with {{convert|660|mi|km}} of shoreline.

Although Millerton Lake, California, Lake Texoma, Oklahoma-Texas, and the north unit of Flaming Gorge, Utah-Wyoming were administered by the Service for a time, the first was subsequently turned over to the State of California, the second to the Army Corps of Engineers, and the last to the Forest Service.

Three more National Recreation Areas established during the 1950s are still in the National Park System today. Shadow Mountain, adjoining the west entrance to [[Rocky Mountain National Park]], embraces the recreational features of Lake Granby and Shadow Mountain Lake, two units of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project. [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area|Glen Canyon]] was established in 1958 to provide for recreational activities on Lake Powell formed behind Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River, one of the highest dams in the world. The [[Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area]], California, was established by Act of Congress in 1962. The National Park Service, however, administers the recreational facilities only at Whiskeytown Reservoir, while the Forest Service takes care of similar, more extensive facilities at Shasta and Trinity.

By 1964, application of the National Recreation Area concept to major impoundments behind Federal dams, whether constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation or the Corps of Engineers, appeared to be well accepted by Congress. Eight more reservations of this type were authorized as additions to the National Park System between 1964 and 1972.

===National Seashores===
[[File:Point Reyes National Seashore headlands from Chimney Rock.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Looking back at the Point Reyes headlands from the Chimney Rock trail in winter. Elephant seals lie in the sand at the bottom of the cliffs. [[Point Reyes National Seashore]]]]The first seashore recreation survey in the mid-1930s resulted in a recommendation that 12 major stretches of unspoiled Atlantic and Gulf Coast shoreline, with {{convert|437|mi|km}} of beach, be preserved. World War II intervened and no action occurred before 1954. Then only one of the proposed areas was created: [[Cape Hatteras National Seashore]], North Carolina. All but one — [[Cape Cod National Seashore|Cape Cod]] — had become commercial developments. A new shoreline surveys resulted in several major reports including Our ''Vanishing Shoreline'' (1955); ''A Report on the Seashore Recreation Survey of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts'' (1955); ''Our Fourth Shore, Great Lakes Shoreline Recreation Area Survey'' (1959); and ''Pacific Coast Recreation Area Survey'' (1959). By 1972 fruits of this program included eight National Seashores and four National Lakeshores of which the first four were authorized before 1964.

The National Seashore concept reached the Pacific Coast in 1962 with authorization of [[Point Reyes National Seashore|Point Reyes]], California, embracing more than forty miles of shoreline including historic Drakes Bay, Tomales Point, and Point Reyes itself. The National Seashore concept reached the Gulf Coast in 1962 also with authorization of [[Padre Island National Seashore|Padre Island]], Texas. This great shore island stretches for {{convert|113|mi|km}} along the Texas coast from Corpus Christi on the north almost to Mexico on the south, and varies in width from a few hundred yards to about three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km). There is some private development at each end of the island.

==The second 50 years; 1966-2016==

The 1960s brought about public awareness of America's natural and historical wealth.  The [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration|Johnson Administration]] became the start of a 'park's for people' mindset.&lt;ref name=Almanac&gt;National Park Service Almanac, Rocky Mountain Region, National Park Service, Office of Public Affairs, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Director [[George B. Hartzog, Jr.|Hartzog]] has been the superintendent of the [[Jefferson National Expansion Memorial]] in [[St. Louis]] and was a supporter of public involvement and publicly accessible parks.  It was the second 50 years that saw a significant increase in parks accessible to the general populations.&lt;ref name=Almanac/&gt;

===Redwood amendment===
[[File:Redwood light.jpg|thumb|{{center|''Sequoia sempervirens'' in Redwood National Park}}]]During the 1960s numerous legal challenges arose over the mission of the National Park Service.  Using the court decisions, Congress supplemented and clarified the [[National Park Service Organic Act|Organic Act of 1916]] through the [[General Authorities Act of 1970]].  Additional challenges during the 1970s required that Congress again clarify the mission of the National Park Service.  The [[Redwood Act (1978)|1979 amendment]] to the General Authorities Act of 1970 has been come known as the “Redwood amendment”, as it also contained language expanding [[Redwood National Park]].  The key part of that act, as amended, is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
‘Congress declares that the national park system, which began with establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872, has since grown to include superlative natural, historic, and recreation areas in every major region of the United States, its territories and island possessions; that these areas, though distinct in character, are united through their inter-related purposes and resources into one national park system as cumulative expressions of a single national heritage; that, individually and collectively, these areas derive increased national dignity and recognition of their superlative environmental quality through their inclusion jointly with each other in one national park system preserved and managed for the benefit and inspiration of all the people of the United States; and that it is the purpose of this Act to include all such areas in the System and to clarify the authorities applicable to the system.  Congress further reaffirms, declares and directs that the promotion and regulation of the various areas of the National Park system, as defined in section Ic of this title, shall be consistent with and founded in the purpose established by section I of this title (the Organic Act provisions), to the common benefit of all the people of the United States.  The authorization of activities shall be construed and the protection, management, and administration of these areas shall be conducted in light of the high public value and integrity of the National Park System and shall not be exercised in derogation of the values and purposes for which these various areas have been established, except as may have been or shall be directly and specifically provided by Congress.’  (16 USC Ia-I)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Management Policies 2001, U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service; December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Lakeshores===
[[File:Pictured Rocks - Grand portal.jpg|thumb|Grand portal at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore]]The first national lakeshores were created in 1966 from some of the remaining unspoiled or unique coastlines of the [[Great Lakes]]. The first lakeshores were [[Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore]] in the Upper Penninsla of Michigan and the [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore]] in Indiana as a part of the [[Greater Chicago]] urban area.&lt;ref name=Almanac/&gt;  In 1970, two additional lakeshores were added.  [[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore]] on Michigans western shore of [[Lake Michigan]], and [[Apostle Islands National Lakeshore]] on [[Wisconsin]]s [[Lake Superior]] shore.&lt;ref name=Almanac/&gt;

===National Heritage Area===
Heritage areas were first established to identify regions having a common cultural impact on the development of the United States.  The [[Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail]] in the Virginia, Maryland and District of Columbia was established on March 28, 1983.  Fourteen areas exited by November 12, 1996.&lt;ref name=Almanac/&gt;  Initially, all the heritage areas were in the east and northeast.  Today, they exist from coast to coast.  The entire State of [[Tennessee]] has been designated as the [http://histpres.mtsu.edu/tncivwar/ Tennessee Civil War Heritage Area]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/heritageareas/ NPS Heritage Areas]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban recreation areas===
During the [[Richard M. Nixon|Richard Nixon]] presidency, public parks expanded with the creation of the two gateway parks.  [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]] in [[San Francisco]] became the western book end to [[Gateway National Recreation Area]] in [[New York City]].  Both were specifically created to serve these two major urban areas and create open space, rather than to preserve a specific scenic or cultural value.&lt;ref name=Almanac/&gt;

On August 15, 1978, [[President Jimmy Carter]] signed into law the creation of the [[Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area]], comprising 15 park units, ranging over 5,000 acres, and included 48 miles of the [[Chattahoochee River]], in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]].

===The Alaska expansion===
[[File:Lake Clark National Park.jpg|thumb|{{center|Lake Clark}}]]In 1977, President [[Jimmy Carter]] created a dozen national monuments, in Alaska.  The controversy that ensued lead to the passage of the [[Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act]] ('''ANILCA''').  Through this act, Congress affirmed the [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]], adding to it.  The act set aside {{convert|47|e6acre|km2}} to the National Park System and {{convert|54|acre|m2}} to the National Wildlife Refuge System.&lt;ref name=Almanac/&gt;  The act provided for the creation or expansion of [[Denali National Park]], [[Wrangell - St Elias National Park and Preserve]], [[Gates Of The Arctic National Park and Preserve]], [[Lake Clark National Park and Preserve]], [[Kobuk Valley National Park]], [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve]], [[Kenai Fjords National Park]], [[Kenai National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Cape Krusenstern National Monument]], [[Admiralty Island National Monument]], [[Misty Fjords National Monument]], [[Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve]], [[Bering Land Bridge National Preserve]], [[Noatak National Preserve]], [[Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve]], [[Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge]], and made significant changes to the notable [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]].

===Reagan years (1981-1989)===
President [[Ronald Reagan]] added eighteen new units to the National Park System during his eight years in the White House.&lt;ref name=NPSRef&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/news/researchlinks.htm NPS Reference website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15794">The '''History of the National Register of Historic Places''' began in 1966 when the [[United States government]] passed the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966|National Historic Preservation Act]] (NHPA), which created the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP). Upon its inception, the U.S. [[National Park Service]] (NPS) became the lead agency for the Register. The Register has continued to grow through two reorganizations, one in the 1970s and one in 1980s and in 1978 the NRHP was completely transferred away from the National Park Service, it was again transmitted to the NPS in 1981.

==Early years==
[[Image:George B. Hartzog Jr.jpg|thumb|right|George B. Hartzog, Jr. Director of the National Park Service from January 8, 1964, until December 31, 1972.&lt;ref name=directors&gt;&quot;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/tolson/histlist6.htm National Park Service Directors and Directorate],&quot; Historic Listing of National Park Service Officials, ''National Park Service''. Retrieved 22 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In April 1966, six months before the National Register of Historic Places was created, the National Park Service's history research programs had been centralized into the office of [[Robert M. Utley]], NPS chief historian, in Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref name=bearss/&gt; as part of an overall plan dubbed &quot;MISSION 66.&quot; On October 15, 1966, the Historic Preservation Act created the National Register of Historic Places and the corresponding [[State Historic Preservation Office]]s.&lt;ref name=act&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/local-law/nhpa1966.htm National Historic Preservation Act of 1966], Public Law 102-575, ''National Register of Historic Places'', Official site. Retrieved 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the National Register consisted of those National Historic Landmarks designated before the Register's creation as well as any other historic sites within the National Park system.&lt;ref name=nhlhistory&gt;Mackintosh, Barry. &quot;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/mackintosh4/nhl.pdf The Historic Sites Survey and National Historic Landmarks Program: A History],&quot; ([[PDF]]), ''National Historic Landmarks Program'', Official site. Retrieved 23 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of the act, which was amended in 1980, represented the first time the United States had a broad based historic preservation policy. While the National Register did not provide specific protection to listed properties it did require federal agencies to assess the impact of activities on buildings and properties listed or eligible for listing on the NRHP. The 1966 act required those agencies to work in conjunction with the SHPO and an independent federal agency, the [[Advisory Council on Historic Preservation]] (ACHP) to confront adverse effects of federal activities on historic preservation.&lt;ref name=fisher/&gt;

Another Interior agency, the National Park Service, had past experience overseeing the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] (1933) and the Historic Sites Survey authorized in 1935. Because of this, and the fact that the Park Service was already managing numerous historic properties within national parks, the NPS was the logical choice to head up the newly created historic preservation program.&lt;ref name=hert/&gt; To encompass the newly created National Register of Historic Places, the National Park Service, under director George B. Hartzog, Jr., created an administrative division called the [[Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation]] (OAHP).&lt;ref name=fisher/&gt;&lt;ref name=scarpino&gt;Scarpino, Philip V. &quot;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0272-3433%28199221%2914%3A2%3C49%3APFPALA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-7 Planning for Preservation: A Look at the Federal-State Historic Preservation Program, 1966-1986 (in The Intergovernmental Politics of Preservation)],&quot; ([[JSTOR]]) ''The Public Historian'', Vol. 14, No. 2. (Spring, 1992), pp. 49-66. Retrieved 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The division oversaw several existing cultural resources programs, including the Historic Sites Survey, Utley's history division and the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]], as well as the new NRHP and [[Historic Preservation Fund]].&lt;ref name=fisher/&gt; Hartzog charged OAHP with creating the National Register program mandated by the 1966 law. Ernest Connally was the Office's first director and it was he who observed that American historic preservation ought be carried out, &quot;with the informed advice and assistance of the professional and scholarly organizations of the disciplines most directly related to the endeavor; namely [[history]], [[architecture]], and [[archeology]].&quot;&lt;ref name=scarpino/&gt; Within OAHP new divisions were created to deal with the National Register.&lt;ref name=bearss&gt;Bearss, Edwin C. &quot;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0272-3433%28198721%299%3A2%3C10%3ATNPSAI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-J The National Park Service and Its History Program: 1864-1986: An Overview (in The National Park Service and Historic Preservation)],&quot; ([[JSTOR]]), ''The Public Historian'', Vol. 9, No. 2, The National Park Service and Historic Preservation. (Spring, 1987), pp. 10-18. Retrieved 22 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The first official [[Keeper of the Register]] was William J. Murtagh, an architectural historian.&lt;ref name=nhlhistory/&gt;

In the Register's earliest years, the late 1960s and early 1970s, organization was lax and SHPO were small, understaffed and underfunded.&lt;ref name=scarpino/&gt; Indeed, money was tight, but funds were still being supplied for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide matching [[grants-in-aid]] to listed property owners, first in house museums  and institutional buildings but later in commercial structures as well.&lt;ref name=fisher/&gt; During this time period, the SHPO had little time to devote to serious planning, even if it wanted to; the demands of saving historic properties and building the organizations from the ground up consumed most of the early state office's resources. As a result, neither the State Historic Preservation Offices nor OAHP really took planning seriously.&lt;ref name=scarpino/&gt; In 1969 Connally told Charles Lee, a State Historic Preservation Officer from [[South Carolina]], &quot;write a paragraph of two on each of these headings. Call it 'The Preliminary South Carolina Historic Preservation Plan.' If it makes any sense at all, I'll approve, and you can file for your brick-and-mortar projects.&quot;&lt;ref name=scarpino/&gt;

==Reorganization==
In 1973 the NPS history programs affiliated with both the U.S. National Parks system and the National Register were formally categorized into two &quot;Assistant Directorates.&quot; Established were the Assistant Directorate for Archeology and Historic Preservation (ADAHP) and the Assistant Directorate for Park Historic Preservation (ADPHP). The Assistant Directorate for Archeology and Historic Preservation dealt with those cultural resources which were external to the National Parks system. The ADAHP included the Grants, National Register, Historical and Architectural Surveys and the Interagency Services Divisions of the Park Service. The ADPHP, on the other hand, dealt primarily with those resources associated internally with the NPS. The ADPHP included the History, Archeology and Historic Architecture Division.&lt;ref name=bearss/&gt;

==Incentives program==
Until 1976 [[tax incentive]]s were virtually non-existent for buildings on the National Register. Before 1976 the federal tax code favored new construction over the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures.&lt;ref name=fisher/&gt; After 1976 the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives which promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The responsibility of ensuring that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for the federal tax incentives fell to the National Park Service. Properties and sites listed on the Register as well as those considered contributing properties to a local historic district &quot;approved by the Park Service&quot; became eligible for the federal tax benefits.&lt;ref name=fisher/&gt;

The 20% tax incentive has very specific clauses indicating when it can be applied.The credit can be used for, &quot;any project that the Secretary of the Interior designates a certified rehabilitation of a certified historic structure.&quot;&lt;ref name=tps2/&gt;

The NHPA made no distinction between properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places and those designated as National Historic Landmarks concerning qualification for tax incentives or grants. This was deliberate on the part of the 1966 act's authors, past experience had shown that categories of significance caused the lowest category to become expendable.&lt;ref name=nhlhistory/&gt; Essentially, this reduced the Landmarks to little more than the &quot;honor roll&quot; of the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name=nhlhistory/&gt;

==Under the Recreation service==
[[Image:Cecil D Andrus.png|thumb|right|150px|U.S. Secretary of the Interior (1977-1981) [[Cecil D. Andrus]] removed the National Register from the jurisdiction of the [[National Park Service]] in 1978.]]
From 1978 until 1981, under President Jimmy Carter's administration, the lead agency for the NRHP was the [[Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service]] (HCRS) within the [[United States Department of Interior]].&lt;ref name=hert&gt;Hertfelder, Eric. &quot;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0272-3433%28198721%299%3A2%3C135%3ATNPSAH%3E2.0.CO%3B2-5 The National Park Service and Historic Preservation: Historic Preservation beyond Smokey the Bear (in Commentary: How Well Is the National Park Service Doing?)],&quot; ([[JSTOR]]), ''The Public Historian'', Vol. 9, No. 2, The National Park Service and Historic Preservation. (Spring, 1987), pp. 135-142. Retrieved 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Park Service's brief period without the Register under its auspices began in the summer of 1978 when the separation between the two directorates established in 1973 became more pronounced. Secretary of the Interior [[Cecil D. Andrus]] transferred authority over the Assistant Directorate for Archeology and Historic Preservation, which included the National Register of Historic Places, to the new Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service.

HCRS' time at the head of, essentially, all programs dealing with historic preservation formerly under the National Park Service, [[Bureau of Outdoor Recreation]] (BOR) and the National Historic Landmarks Program, was tumultuous.&lt;ref name=scarpino/&gt; Carter brought in administrator Chris T. Delaporte, former head of the BOR, to lead the upstart HCRS, his assertive management style and lack of experience in [[historic preservation]] further separated state and federal entities on the topic and touched off protest from the states.&lt;ref name=scarpino/&gt;

When [[James G. Watt]] was appointed to the Interior post by Ronald Reagan among his first moves was to abolish the HCRS. This move transferred the divisions under its control, then under the leadership of Jerry L. Rogers, back to the National Park Service.&lt;ref name=bearss/&gt;

==Second reorganization==
In February 1983 the two assistant directorates, created in 1973, were merged to promote efficiency and recognize that the cultural resource programs associated with both directorates were interdependent. Rogers, described as a skilled administrator who was sensitive to the need for the NPS to work with SHPO, academia and local governments, was picked to lead this newly merged associate directorate. When the NPS had reorganized in the mid-1960s it had eliminated the positions of regional historians and chosen instead to merge those positions into Utley's Washington office. The 1983 reorganization of the directorates in control of Register activities represented a return to the organization pre-MISSION 66.&lt;ref name=bearss/&gt;

==1990s==

==Work with State offices==
The NHPA established the historic preservation plan for the United States not based on a U.S. governmental model but rather on that of a highly decentralized system allowing the states to carry out activities which would allow the federal government to meet the standards of the 1966 act.&lt;ref name=hert/&gt; Though it was not initially spelled out in the 1966 act reliance on the SHPO eventually became important as part of the process of listing properties on the National Register. The 1980 amendments to the law further laid out the responsibilities of SHPO concerning the federal Register.&lt;ref name=hert/&gt;

By 1987 State Historic Preservation Offices existed in 57 separate jurisdictions, all fifty [[U.S. state|states]] and several [[United States territories|territories]]. The SHPOs help make the management of the National Register and its affiliated incentive programs possible, with the states assuming much of the responsibility for monitoring rehabilitation construction on Registered Historic Places. The result is that the NPS sets standards and priorities, administers the grants program, and maintains quality control, while the SHPO carry out the work as agents of the federal government.&lt;ref name=hert/&gt;

==Growth==
The National Register of Historic Places has grown considerably from its beginnings as legislation in 1966. In 1986 citizens and groups nominated 3,623 separate properties, sites and districts for inclusion on the NRHP, a total of 75,000 separate properties.&lt;ref name=hert/&gt; By 1998, including historic districts and individually listed buildings there were over 1,000,000 buildings, sites and structures listed on the Register. Each year an additional 30,000 are added.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;Fisher, Charles E. &quot;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0848-8525%281998%2929%3A3%2F4%3C7%3APTPOHB%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z Promoting the Preservation of Historic Buildings: Historic Preservation Policy in the United States],&quot; ([[JSTOR]]), ''APT Bulletin'', Vol. 29, No. 3/4, Thirtieth-Anniversary Issue.

{{US Constitution article series}}
The '''Admission to the Union''' Clause of the [[United States Constitution]], oftentimes called the '''New States''' Clause, and found at Article IV, Section 3, [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Clause 1: New states|Clause 1]], authorizes the [[United States Congress|Congress]] to admit new [[U.S. state|states]] into the [[United States]] beyond the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen]] already in existence at the time the Constitution went [[Coming into force|into effect]].

The Constitution went into effect on June 21, 1788, after ratification by 9 of the 13 states, and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] began operations under it on March 4, 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=March 4: A forgotten huge day in American history|url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2013/03/march-4-a-forgotten-huge-day-in-american-politics/|publisher=[[National Constitution Center]]|accessdate=October 21, 2015|location=Philadelphia|date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, 37 additional states have been admitted into the Union. Each new state has been admitted on an [[equal footing]] with those already in existence.&lt;ref name=DEoS&gt;{{cite web|title=Doctrine of the Equality of States|url=http://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-4/22-doctrine-of-equality-of-states.html|website=Justia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 37 states admitted to the Union by Congress, all but six have been established from an existing U.S. [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|organized incorporated territory]]. A state so created might encompass all or a portion of a territory. When the people of a territory or a region thereof would make their desire for statehood known to the federal government, in most cases Congress passed an [[enabling act]] authorizing the people of that territory or region to frame a proposed [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]] as a step towards admission to the Union. Although the use of an enabling act was a common historic practice, a number of territories drafted constitutions for submission to Congress without one, but were still admitted to the Union.

An enabling act would detail the mechanism by which the territory would be admitted as a state following ratification of their constitution and election of state officers. Although the use of such an act is a traditional historic practice, a number of territories have drafted constitutions for submission to Congress absent an enabling act and were subsequently admitted. The broad outline for this process was established by the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]] and the 1787 [[Northwest Ordinance]], both of which predate the present U.S. Constitution.

The Admission to the Union Clause also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and Congress. The primary intent of this caveat was to give Eastern states that still had [[State cessions|Western land claims]] (there were four at that time), to have a [[veto]] over whether their western counties could become states.&lt;ref name=4.3.1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Essays on Article IV: New States Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/4/essays/125/new-states-clause|work=The Heritage Guide to the Constitution|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This clause has served the same function since, each time a [[List of U.S. state partition proposals|proposal to partition]] an existing state or states has arisen.

==Background==

===Articles of Confederation===
Between 1781 and 1789 the United States was governed by a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] Congress, the [[Congress of the Confederation]], which operated under authority granted to it by the [[Articles of Confederation]], the nation's first constitution. The Articles authorized Congress to admit new states to the Union provided nine states consented.

During this period, the Confederation Congress enacted two ordinances governing the admission of new states into the Union. The first such ordinance was the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]], enacted April 23, 1784.&lt;ref name=breakthrough&gt;{{cite book |author1=Grupo de Investigadores Puertorriqueños |title=Breakthrough From Colonialism: An Interdisciplinary Study of Statehood |date=1984 |publisher=University of Puerto Rico |volume=1 |isbn=9780847724895 |oclc=836947912 |pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] was its principal author. The Ordinance called for the land (recently confirmed as part of the United States by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]) west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], north of the [[Ohio River]] and east of the [[Mississippi River]] to eventually be divided into ten separate states. Once a given area reached 20,000 inhabitants, it could call a constitutional convention and form a [[provisional government]]. Then, upon enacting a state constitution which affirmed that the new state would forever be part of the Confederation, would be subject to the Articles of Confederation and acts of Congress, would be subject to payment for federal debts and would not tax federal properties within the state border or tax non-residents at a rate higher than residents, and would have a [[republican form of government]],&lt;ref name=breakthrough/&gt;  and also after reaching a population equal to that of the least-populated of the established states, it would be admitted, on an equal footing with all other states, based on a majority vote in Congress.&lt;ref name=breakthrough/&gt; Jefferson's original draft of the ordinance gave names to the proposed states, and also contained a provision that &quot;After the year 1800 there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://jeffersonswest.unl.edu/archive/view_doc.php?id=jef.00155 | title = Report from the Committee for the Western Territory to the United States Congress | work = Envisaging the West: Thomas Jefferson and the Roots of Lewis and Clark | publisher = [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] and [[University of Virginia]] | date = March 1, 1784 | accessdate = April 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1784 ordinance was superseded three years later by the [[Northwest Ordinance of 1787]]. Enacted by the Confederation Congress on July 13, 1787, it created the [[Northwest Territory]], the first [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|organized incorporated territory]] of the United States. The Northwest Ordinance (Article V) provided for the admission of several new states from within its bounds:
{{quote| There shall be formed in the said territory, not less than three nor more than five States&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;And, whenever any of the said States shall have sixty thousand free inhabitants therein, such State shall be admitted, by its delegates, into the Congress of the United States, on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever, and shall be at liberty to form a permanent constitution and State government: Provided, the constitution and government so to be formed, shall be republican, and in conformity to the principles contained in these articles; and, so far as it can be consistent with the general interest of the confederacy, such admission shall be allowed at an earlier period, and when there may be a less number of free inhabitants in the State than sixty thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northwest Ordinance; July 13, 1787|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/nworder.asp|work=Avalon Project|publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library, Yale Law School|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Considered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation Congress,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northwest Ordinance|url=http://loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/northwest.html|website=loc.gov|publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; it established the precedent by which the Federal government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states and their established sovereignty under the Articles of Confederation.

No new states were formed in the Northwest Territory under either ordinance. In August, 1789, the ordinance was replaced by the Northwest Ordinance of 1789, in which the new Congress (under the present Constitution) reaffirmed the Ordinance with slight modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horsman|first1=Reginald|title=The Northwest Ordinance and the Shaping of an Expanding Republic|journal=The Wisconsin Magazine of History|date=Autumn 1989|volume=73|issue=1|pages=21–32|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4636235|accessdate=April 19, 2016|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory itself remained in existence until 1803, when the southeastern portion of it was admitted to the Union as the State of [[Ohio]], and the remainder was reorganized.

During this period, the Confederation Congress considered other ordinances providing for the admission of new states into the Union. On August 20, 1781, it passed a resolution clearing the way for the then unrecognized [[Vermont Republic|state of Vermont]] to enter the Union, provided it would give up its claims to territory west of [[Lake Champlain]] and east of the [[Connecticut River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mello&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mello|first=Robert A.|title=Moses Robinson and the Founding of Vermont|publisher=Vermont Historical Society|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following spring, the legislature of Vermont agreed to those terms.  However, Vermont's admission would be delayed for nearly a decade, due largely to opposition from New York, which asserted a disputed claim to the region.

On May 16, 1785, a resolution to admit [[State of Franklin|Frankland]] (later modified to Franklin) to the Union was introduced in Congress. Eventually, seven states voted to admit what would have been the 14th state. This was, however, less than the nine states required. This would-be-state was created in 1784 from part of the territory west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] that had been offered by [[North Carolina]] as a cession to Congress to help pay off debts related to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. It continued to exist as an ''extra-legal'' state through mid-1788, when North Carolina re-assumed full control of the area. Franklin later became part of the [[Southwest Territory]], which still later became the state of Tennessee.

In July, 1788, Congress began deliberations on whether to admit [[Kentucky]] to the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kesavan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vasan|first=Kesavan|title=When did the Articles of Confederation Cease to Be Law?|journal=[[Notre Dame Law Review]]|volume=78|issue=1|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kentucky was then a part of [[Virginia]].  The legislature of Virginia had consented to the creation of the new state from its western district.  However, when Congress began to discuss the matter, they received notification that [[New Hampshire]] had ratified the Constitution, becoming the ninth state to do so, causing it to go into effect in the ratifying states, and instead passed a resolution stating that it was &quot;unadvisable&quot; to admit a new state under those circumstances and the matter should wait until the federal government under the Constitution came into existence. As a result, no new states were admitted to the Union while the Articles of Confederation were in effect.

===1787 Constitutional Convention===
At the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], a proposal to include the phrase, &quot;new States shall be admitted on the same terms with the original States&quot;,  in the ''new states'' clause was defeated. That proposal would have taken the policy articulated in the Ordinance of 1784 and made it a constitutional imperative. Many delegates objected to including the phrase however, fearing that the political power of future new western states would eventually overwhelm that of the established eastern states.

Delegates, understanding that the number of states would inevitably increase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madison Debates, July 23, 1787|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_723.asp|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; did agree to include wording into this clause to preclude formation of a new state out of an established one without the consent of the established state as well as the Congress.&lt;ref name=4.3.1/&gt; It was anticipated that Kentucky (which was a part of Virginia), Franklin (which was a part of North Carolina), Vermont (to which New York asserted a disputed claim), and eventually Maine (which was a part of Massachusetts), would become states. As a result of this compromise, new breakaway states are permitted to join the Union, but only with the proper consents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Kesavan|first= Vasan|last2= Paulsen|first2= Michael Stokes|year= 2002|title= Is West Virginia Unconstitutional?|url= http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol90/iss2/1/|journal= [[California Law Review]]|publisher= |volume= 90|issue= 2|page= 395|doi= |pmc= |pmid= |ref={{harvid|Kesavan|Paulsen|2002}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equal footing doctrine==
Shortly after the new Constitution went into effect Congress admitted [[Vermont]] and Kentucky on equal terms with the existing 13 states, and thereafter formalized the condition in its [[Act of Congress|acts]] of admission for subsequent states. Thus the Congress, utilizing the discretion allowed by the framers, adopted a policy of equal status for all newly admitted states.&lt;ref name=4.3.1/&gt; The constitutional principle derived from these actions is known as the [[equal footing]] doctrine. With the growth of [[states' rights]] advocacy during the [[antebellum period]], the Supreme Court asserted, in ''Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan'' (1845), that the Constitution mandated admission of new states on the basis of equality.&lt;ref name=DEoS/&gt;

==Admission process==
[[File:US states by date of statehood3.gif|thumb|350px|The order in which the original 13 states ratified the constitution, then the order in which the others were admitted to the union.]]
Historically, most new states brought into being by Congress have been established from an organized incorporated U.S. territory, created and governed by Congress in accord with its [[plenary power]] under Article IV, Section 3, [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Property Clause|Clause 2]] of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Property and Territory: Powers of Congress|url=http://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-4/25-methods-of-disposing-property.html|website=Justia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, an entire territory became a state; in others some part of a territory became a state. In most cases, the organized government of a territory made known the sentiment of its population in favor of statehood, usually by referendums. Congress then directed that government to organize a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] to write a [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]]. Upon acceptance of that constitution, Congress has always admitted that territory as a state. However, Congress has ultimate authority over the admission of new states, and is not bound to follow this procedure.

Congress is under no obligation to admit states, even in those areas whose population expresses a desire for statehood. In one instance, [[Mormon pioneers]] in [[Salt Lake City]] sought to establish the state of [[State of Deseret|Deseret]] in 1849. It existed for slightly over two years and was never approved by the [[United States Congress]]. In another, leaders of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole) in [[Indian Territory]] proposed to establish the state of [[State of Sequoyah|Sequoyah]] in 1905, as a means to retain control of their lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;museum&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumoftheredriver.org/choctaw.html | title=Museum of the Red River - The Choctaw| year=2005| accessdate=4 August 2009| publisher=Museum of the Red River}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed constitution ultimately failed in the U.S. Congress. Instead, the Indian Territory was incorporated into the new state of Oklahoma in 1907.

Some U.S. territories existed only a short time before becoming states, while others remained territories for decades. The shortest-lived was [[Alabama Territory]] at 2 years, while [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]] and [[Hawaii Territory|Hawaii]] territories both were in existence for more than 50 years. The entry of several states into the Union has been delayed due to complicating factors. Among them, [[Michigan Territory]], which petitioned Congress for statehood in 1835, was not admitted to the Union until 1837, due to a [[Toledo War|boundary dispute]] the adjoining state of Ohio. The [[Republic of Texas]] requested annexation to the United States in 1837, but fears about potential conflict with Mexico delayed the admission of Texas for nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Richard Bruce |last= Winders |title= Crisis in the Southwest: the United States, Mexico, and the Struggle over Texas |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mcc9EciebFYC |year= 2002 |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn= 978-0-8420-2801-1 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=mcc9EciebFYC&amp;pg=PA82 82], [https://books.google.com/books?id=mcc9EciebFYC&amp;pg=PA92 92] |via= [[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, statehood for [[Kansas Territory]] was held up for several years (1854–61) due to a series of internal [[Bleeding Kansas|violent conflicts]] involving [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|anti-slavery]] and [[Border Ruffian|pro-slavery]] factions.

Once established, most state borders have, with few exceptions, been generally stable. Notable exceptions include: the various portions (the Western land claims) of several original states ceded over a period of several years to the federal government, which in turn became the Northwest Territory, [[Southwest Territory]], and [[Mississippi Territory]]; the 1791 cession by Maryland and Virginia of land to create the [[District of Columbia]] (Virginia's portion was [[District of Columbia retrocession|returned]] in 1847); and the creation, on at least three separate occasions, of a new state ([[Kentucky]], [[Maine]] and [[West Virginia]]) from a region of an existing state. (Vermont was created from what was disputedly claimed to be a part of New York and was not admitted until New York consented.) However, there have been numerous minor adjustments to state boundaries over the years due to improved surveys, resolution of ambiguous or disputed boundary definitions, or minor mutually agreed boundary adjustments for administrative convenience or other purposes.&lt;ref name=StatesShapes&gt;{{cite book |last= Stein |first= Mark |title= How the States Got Their Shapes |year= 2008 |publisher= HarperCollins |location= New York |isbn= 9780061431395 |pages= xvi, 334}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable example is the case [[New Jersey v. New York]], in which [[New Jersey]] won roughly 90% of [[Ellis Island]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Linda |last=  Greenhouse |date= May 27, 1998 |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/27/nyregion/ellis-island-verdict-ruling-high-court-gives-new-jersey-most-ellis-island.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=The Ellis Island Verdict: The Ruling; High Court Gives New Jersey Most of Ellis Island |work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==States that were never part of an organized U.S. territory==
In addition to the original 13, six subsequent states were never part of an organized incorporated U.S. territory. Kentucky, Maine, and West Virginia were each set off from already existing states.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael P. Riccards]], &quot;Lincoln and the Political Question: The Creation of the State of West Virginia&quot; ''Presidential Studies Quarterly,'' Vol. 27, 1997 [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=5000522904 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Texas and Vermont both entered the Union after having been [[sovereign state]]s (''[[de facto]]'' sovereignty in Vermont's case, as the region was claimed by [[New York (state)|New York]]). California was set off from [[unorganized territory|unorganized]] land [[Mexican Cession|ceded]] to the United States by [[Mexico]] in 1848 at the end of the [[Mexican–American War]].

The '''[[Temperance movement]] in the United States''' was a movement to curb the consumption of [[alcohol]]. It had a large influence on American politics and society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

[[File:The Drunkard's Progress - Color.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The Drunkard's Progress: A lithograph by [[Nathaniel Currier]] supporting the temperance movement, January 1846.]]

== Early Temperance: 1784-1861 ==
[[File:John Jr Wiltberger, Temperance Map, 1838 Cornell CUL PJM 1049 01.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.4|An early allegorical map of temperance by John Jr Wiltberger, 1838. ]]
[[File:Stedman Wright; Rudd, Nathaniel Hanks, Black Valley Rail Road, 1863, Cornell, CUL, PJM 1066 01.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.4|An allegorical map on temperance, based on the notion of alcohol as a train ride to destruction, the &quot;Black Valley Rail Road&quot; by the Massachusetts Temperance Alliance, 1863.]]
In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, various factors contributed to an epidemic of alcoholism that went hand-in-hand with spousal abuse, family neglect, and chronic unemployment. Americans used to drinking lightly alcoholic beverages like cider &quot;from the crack of dawn to the crack of dawn&quot; began ingesting far more alcohol as they drank more of strong, cheap beverages like rum (in the colonial period) and whiskey (in the post-Revolutionary period).&lt;ref name=Rorabaugh&gt;{{cite book|last=W.J.|first=Rorabaugh|title=The Alcohol Republic: An American Tradition |url=http://www.amazon.com/The-Alcoholic-Republic-American-Tradition/dp/0195029909|accessdate=2012-10-28|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-1950-2990-1|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular pressure for cheap and plentiful alcohol led to relaxed [[local ordinance|ordinances]] on alcohol sales.

The Temperance movement sparked to life with [[Benjamin Rush]]'s 1784 tract, ''An Inquiry Into the Effects of Ardent Spirits Upon the Human Body and Mind'', which judged the excessive use of alcohol injurious to physical and psychological health. Apparently influenced by Dr. Rush's ''Inquiry'', about 200 farmers in a [[Connecticut]] community formed a temperance association in 1789 to ban the making of [[whiskey]]. Similar associations were formed in [[Virginia]] in 1800, and [[New York State]] in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blocker|first=Jack S.|title=American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform|year=1989|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=Boston|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next decade, other temperance organizations were formed in eight states, some being statewide organizations. The young movement advocated temperance or levelness rather than abstinence. Many leaders of the movement expanded their activities and took positions on observance of the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]] and other moral issues, and by the early 1820s political in-fighting had stalled the movement.

Some leaders persevered in pressing their cause forward. Americans such as [[Lyman Beecher]], who was a Connecticut minister, had started to lecture his fellow citizens against all use of liquor in 1825. The [[American Temperance Society]] was formed in 1826 and benefited from a renewed interest in religion and morality. Within 12 years it claimed more than 8,000 local groups and over 1,500,000 members. By 1839, 18 temperance journals were being published. Simultaneously, some [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church leaders were beginning to promote temperance. The movement split along two lines in the late 1830s: between moderates allowing some drinking and radicals demanding total abstinence, and between voluntarists relying on moral suasion alone and prohibitionists promoting laws to restrict or ban alcohol. Radicals and prohibitionists dominated many of the largest temperance organizations after the 1830s, and temperance eventually became synonymous with prohibition.

The Civil War dealt the movement a crippling blow. Temperance groups in the South were then weaker than their Northern counterparts and too voluntarist to gain any statewide prohibition law, and the few prohibition laws in the North were repealed by the war's end. Both sides in the war made alcohol sales a part of the war effort by taxing brewers and distillers to finance much of the conflict. The issue of slavery crowded out temperance and temperance groups petered out until they found new life in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Yours for the Oppressed&quot;: The Life of Jehiel C. Beman

===Temperance Theatre===
Temperance birthed an entire genre of theatre. This was first seen in 1825, as ''The Forgers'', a dramatic poem written by John Blake White, premiered at the Charleston Theatre in Charleston, South Carolina. The next significant temperance drama to debut was titled &quot;Fifteen Years of a Drunkard's Life&quot;, written by Douglas Jerrold in 1841. As the movement began to grow and prosper, these dramas became more popular among the general public. &quot;[[The Drunkard]]&quot; by W.H. Smith premiered in 1841 in Boston, running for 144 performances before being produced at P.T. Barnum's American Museum on lower Broadway. The play was wildly popular and is often credited with the entrance of the temperance narrative into mainstream American theatre. It continued to be a staple of New York's theatre scene all the way until 1875. &quot;The Drunkard&quot; follows the typical format of a temperance drama: the main character has an alcohol-induced downfall, and he restores his life from disarray once he denounces drinking for good at the play's end. Temperance drama continued to grow as a genre of theatre, fostered by the advent of the railroad as a form of transportation. This enabled theatre companies to be much more mobile, traveling from city to city. Temperance drama would even reach as far as the West Coast, as David Belasco's adaptation of Émile Zola's novel &quot;Drink&quot; premiered at the Baldwin Theatre in San Francisco in 1879. The image titled ''The Drunkards Progress'' shown in the top of the article, gives us a representation of the temperance movement. This image depicts the progress of a drunk man, slowly the woman disappears, and the mans night ends in death. This picture shows us that drinking is social but also brings poverty upon people as well as death and loneliness.

===Early victories in Maine===
Maine was an early hotbed of the temperance movement. The world's first '''Total Abstinence Society''' was formed in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] in 1815, and a statewide temperance group formed in 1834.&lt;ref name=PortlandHerald&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bouchard|first1=Kelley|title=When Maine went dry|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2011/10/02/when-maine-went-dry_2011-10-02/|accessdate=4 January 2016|publisher=Portland Press Herald|date=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups won a major victory in 1838 when they pressured the state legislature to pass the '''Fifteen Gallon Law''', which prohibited the sale of spirits in quantities of less than that amount.&lt;ref name=Gately261&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Ian|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|date=2009|publisher=Gotham Books|location=London|isbn=978-1592404643|pages=261-262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its practical effect was to make hard liquor available to the wealthy, who were the only ones who could afford such quantities.&lt;ref name=Gately261 /&gt; It was repealed within two years.&lt;ref name=Gately261 /&gt; However, in 1851 the so-called [[Maine law]] passed, which banned the production and sale of alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref name=PortlandHerald /&gt; Thus Maine became the first &quot;dry&quot; state. However, the law's exception for “medicinal, mechanical and manufacturing purposes” meant that liquor was still available for some.&lt;ref name=PortlandHerald /&gt;

== Second Wave Temperance: 1872-1893 ==
As [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] came to a close in the 1870s, most white reformers grew uninterested in racial equality and invested more energy into temperance.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001), ''Grant'', p. 547&lt;/ref&gt; This period produced various temperance organizations including the prohibitionist [[Women's Christian Temperance Union|Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU, f. 1874) and the voluntarist Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America (CTAU, f. 1872). Prohibitionist temperance grew popular in the South as it embraced the &quot;Southern&quot; values of racial hierarchy, gender roles, and honor.&lt;ref name=Coker&gt;{{cite book |last=Coker |first=Joe L. |title=Liquor in the Land of the Lost Cause: Southern White Evangelicals and the Prohibition Movement|location=Lexington, KY |publisher= University of Kentucky Press |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national movement enlisted more religious support throughout the country, especially from evangelicals.

===Temperance education===
In 1873, the WCTU established a [[Department of Scientific Temperance Instruction]] in Schools and Colleges, with [[Mary Hunt]] as National Superintendent. The WCTU was an influential organization with a membership of 120,000 by 1879.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] led the group under the motto &quot;Do Everything&quot; to protect women and children. Some of the changes the WCTU sought included property and custody rights for women, women's suffrage, raising the age of consensual sex, peace arbitration, women's education, and advocacy for working rights of women.&lt;ref name=Christianity1998&gt;Howard Clark Kee, Emily Albu, Carter Lindberg, J. William Frost, Dana L. Robert (1998). ''Christianity: A Social and Cultural History''. 2nd edition. Prentice Hall, River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harriman temperance university abt1906.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard depicting Temperance Hall]]
Because of the correlation between drinking and domestic violence—many drunken husbands abused family members—the temperance movement existed alongside various [[feminism|women's rights]] and other movements, including the [[progressivism|Progressive]] movement, and often the same activists were involved in multiple movements. Many notable voices of the time, ranging from [[Lucy Webb Hayes]] to [[Susan B. Anthony]], were active in temperance. In [[Canada]], [[Nellie McClung]] was a longstanding advocate of temperance. As with most social movements, there was a gamut of activists running from violent ([[Carrie Nation]]) to mild ([[Neal S. Dow]]).

The [[American Temperance University]] opened in 1893 in the planned town of [[Harriman, Tennessee]], which was developed as a community with no alcoholic beverages permitted. In its second year of operation the institution enrolled 345 students from 20 states. However, it closed in 1908.

===Temperance fountains===
{{main|Temperance fountain}}
Muddied and ill-tasting drinking water encouraged many Americans to drink alcohol for health purposes, so temperance groups constructed public drinking fountains throughout the United States following the Civil War. The National Woman's Christian Temperance Union (NWCTU)'s organizing convention of 1874 strongly encouraged its attendees to erect the fountains in the places that they had come from. The NWCTU advocated public temperance fountains as a means to discourage males from entering drinking establishment for refreshment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WCTU Drinking Fountains - Then and Now|url=http://www.wctu.org/fountains.html|work=Woman's Christian Temperance Union|publisher=Woman's Christian Temperance Union|accessdate=9 June 2012|author=Staff|year=1996–2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cast-stone statues of [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] were marketed for use in temperance fountains. In [[Union Square Park]]{&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/union-square-park/monuments/797]&lt;/ref&gt; (New York City) the James Fountain (1881), is a Temperance fountain with the figure of Charity who empties her jug of water, aided by a child; it was donated by Daniel Willis James and sculpted by [[Adolf Donndorf]]. In Washington DC &quot;the&quot; [[Temperance Fountain]] was donated to the city in 1882 by Temperance crusader [[Henry D. Cogswell]]. This fountain was one of a series of fountains he designed and commissioned in a belief that easy access to cool drinking water would keep people from consuming alcohol. Under its stone canopy the words &quot;Faith,&quot; &quot;Hope,&quot; &quot;Charity,&quot; and &quot;Temperance&quot; are chiseled. Atop this canopy is a life-sized [[heron]], and the centerpiece is a pair of entwined heraldic scaly [[dolphin]]s. Originally, visitors were supposed to freely drink ice water flowing from the dolphins' snouts with a [[brass]] cup attached to the fountain and the overflow was collected by a [[Trough (food)|trough]] for [[horse]]s, but the city tired of having to replenish the ice in a reservoir underneath the base and disconnected the supply pipes. Other Cogswell fountains include one still standing in New York City's Tompkins Square Park.&lt;ref&gt;http://thevillager.com/2012/09/20/history-lessons-flow-from-two-temperance-fountains/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/tompkins-square-park/history&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Benson]], an Oregon lumberman, was a tee-totaler who wanted to discourage his workers from drinking alcohol in the middle of the day. In 1912, Benson gave the [[Portland, Oregon|City of Portland]] USD$10,000 for the installation of twenty bronze drinking fountains. As of May, 2012, these fountains, known as [[Benson Bubbler|&quot;Benson Bubblers&quot;]], continue to be used as functional public drinking devices in downtown Portland; two Portland &quot;Benson Bubbler&quot; locations are Eastbank Esplanade and the corner of &quot;3rd and Burnside&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Water Bureau: Benson Bubbler bowl was stolen|url=http://www.kptv.com/story/17649428/water-bureau-reports-benson-bubbler-bowl-was-stolen|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=FOX 12 Oregon|date=20 May 2012|author=Jolie Wolfe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benson Bubbler, 3rd and Burnside.

== Third Wave Temperance: 1893-1933 ==
The last wave of temperance in the United States saw the rise of the Anti-Saloon League, which successfully pushed for National Prohibition from its enactment in 1920 to its repeal in 1933. This heavily prohibitionist wave attracted a diverse coalition: doctors, pastors, and eugenicists; Klansmen and liberal internationalists; business leaders and labor radicals; conservative evangelicals and liberal theologians.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Nation of Drunkards.&quot; Prohibition. Produced by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick. 2 hours. PBS video, DVD, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-Saloon League ===
Rev. Howard Hyde Russell founded the [[Anti-Saloon League]] (ASL) in 1893. Under the leadership of [[Wayne Wheeler]] the ASL stressed political results and perfected the art of [[pressure politics]]. It did not demand that politicians change their drinking habits, only their votes in the legislature. Other organizations like the [[Prohibition Party]] and the WCTU soon lost influence to the better-organized and more focused ASL.

The ASL's motto was &quot;the Church in action against the saloon,&quot; and it mobilized its religious coalition to pass state (and local) legislation (establishing [[dry state]]s and [[Dry county|dry counties]]).

By the late nineteenth century, most Protestant denominations and the American wing of the Catholic Church supported the movement to legally restrict the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. These groups believed that alcohol consumption led to [[corruption]], [[prostitution]], [[spousal abuse]] and other criminal activities. Brewers and distillers resisted the reform movement, which threatened to ruin their livelihood, and also feared women having the vote, because they expected women to vote for prohibition.&lt;ref name=Christianity1998/&gt;

Energized by the anti-German sentiment during World War I, the ASL achieved its main goal of passage on December 18, 1917&amp;mdash;the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]]. Upon ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures by January 16, 1919, established National Prohibition. (the Amendment came into effect on January 16, 1920)
Prohibition banned &quot;the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages in the United States and its possessions.&quot; However, Prohibition did not outlaw the purchase or consumption of alcohol products.

[[File:Emigrants crossing the Plains 1859.png|thumb|upright=1.75|right|alt=A drawing of European American homesteaders and their wagons|European American emigrants on their way to California, {{circa|1859}}]]

The '''Rose–Baley Party''' was the first [[European American]] emigrant [[wagon train]] to traverse the [[35th parallel north|35th parallel]] route known as [[Beale's Wagon Road]], established by [[Edward Fitzgerald Beale]], from [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico]] to the [[Colorado River]] near present-day [[Needles, California]].

In 1858, a wealthy businessman from [[Keosauqua, Iowa]], [[Leonard John Rose]], formed the party after hearing stories from gold miners returning from California. He subsequently financed a well-equipped wagon train that included twenty horses and two hundred head of [[purebred]] red [[Shorthorn|Durham]] cattle. He also acquired four large [[covered wagon]]s and three [[yoke]] of oxen to pull them each wagon. The Rose company left Iowa in early April, and in mid-May they were joined by the Baley company, led by a forty-four-year-old veteran of the [[Black Hawk War]], [[Gillum Baley]]. Their combined outfits numbered twenty wagons, forty men, fifty to sixty women and children, and nearly five hundred head of cattle. [[John Udell]], a 62-year-old Baptist minister kept a daily journal of the party's travels, recording the locations of their campsites, documenting their progress, and noting the availability of resources.

On August 30, 1858, after having traveled more than {{convert|1200|mi}} in four months, the Rose–Baley Party were attacked by three hundred [[Mohave people|Mohave]] warriors as they prepared to cross the Colorado River. Eight members of the party were killed, including five children, and thirteen wounded. The emigrants held off the assault, killing seventeen Mohave, but decided to backtrack more than {{convert|500|mi}} to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], instead of continuing on to their intended destination in southern California.

==Sourcing==
According to Charles W. Baley, great-grand nephew of Baley company leader, Gillum Baley, and the author of ''Disaster at the Colorado: Beale's Wagon Road and the First Emigrant Party'' (2002), little has been written about [[Beale's Wagon Road]] because the negative experiences of the first wagon trains to attempt the passage effectively &quot;discouraged its use&quot;.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=vii}} Baley's great-grandparents joined his great-great uncle in forming the company in 1858, which merged with one led by [[Leonard John Rose]] to make the Rose–Baley Party.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=vii}}

Baley's account drew heavily from the only known journal kept by a member of the group. [[John Udell]], a 62-year-old Baptist minister who had left his home in Missouri with his wife, Emily, kept a daily record of the party's travels, recording the locations of their campsites and their estimated distance from Missouri, the weather and road conditions, and the availability of grass, water, and wood.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=viii, 5–7, 15–16}} Baley described Udell's journal as the &quot;basic framework&quot; of his research.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=viii}} The only other source of firsthand information is Rose, whose account was printed in the ''Missouri Republican'' in 1859, and later reprinted as an appendix in Dr. Robert Glass Cleland's work, ''The Cattle on a Thousand Hills: Southern California, 1850-1880''.{{sfn|Belden|1951|p=43}}

==E.F. Beale expedition==
[[File:EFBeale.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A black and white photograph of a mustachioed man|E.F. Beale]]

In October 1857, an expedition led by [[Edward Fitzgerald Beale]] was tasked with establishing a trade route along the [[35th parallel north|35th parallel]] from [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], Arkansas to [[Los Angeles]], California.{{sfn|Thrapp|1991|p=76}}{{refn|group=nb|Beale's Wagon Road would eventually be supplanted first by the railroad, then [[U.S. Route 66]], and later, [[Interstate 40]].{{sfn|Lutzick|2013|p=8}}}} The wagon road began at Fort Smith and continued through [[Fort Defiance, Arizona]] before crossing the [[Colorado River]] near present-day [[Needles, California]].{{sfn|Ricky|1999|p=100}}{{refn|group=nb|The [[Mojave Road]] stretches from where Beale's Wagon Road meets the Colorado River to southern California.{{sfn|Hinckley|2012|p=32}}}} The location where Beale crossed the river, en route to California, became known as Beale's Crossing.{{sfn|Utley|1981|p=164}} Beale described the route, &quot;It is the shortest from our western frontier by {{convert|300|mi}}, being nearly directly west. It is the most level: our wagons only double-teaming once in the entire distance, and that at a short hill, and over a surface heretofore unbroken by wheels or trail on any kind. It is well-watered: our greatest distance without water at any time being {{convert|20|mi}}. It is well-timbered, and in many places the growth is far beyond that of any part of the world I have ever seen. It is temperate in climate, passing for the most part over an elevated region. It is salubrious: not one of our party requiring the slightest medical attendance from the time of our leaving to our arrival&amp;nbsp;... It crosses the great desert (which must be crossed by any road to California) at its narrowest point.&quot;{{sfn|Bonsal|1912|p=213}}

==Formation==
During the summer of 1858, a large emigrant [[wagon train]] became the first to traverse Beale's 35th parallel route to [[Mohave people|Mohave]] country.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=24, 28–37, 39–40}} A wealthy businessman from [[Keosauqua, Iowa]], Leonard John Rose, known as L.J. Rose, formed a company with his family of seven, his foreman, Alpha Brown, and his family, and seventeen grubstakers, workers who were not paid a salary, but given food and board in exchange for their labor. Rose was born in [[Rottenburg am Neckar|Rottenburg]], Germany in 1827; at the age of eight, he immigrated to the United States.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=2–3}} In 1892, writing in ''The Californian'', he identified what motivated him to leave Iowa, where he had built several successful businesses:
{{Quote|In 1858 some miners who had just returned from California so fired my imagination with descriptions of its glorious climate, wealth of flowers, and luscious fruits, that I was inspired with an irresistible desire to experience in person the delights to be found in the land of plenty.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=3}}}}
[[File:The How and Why Library 009.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A pencil drawing of a large prairie schooner being drawn by two oxen, with attendant cowboys|A &quot;prairie schooner&quot; covered wagon, 1909]]

To finance the venture, Rose sold the majority of his assets, and after paying off his debts was left with $30,000, then a considerable amount of money. These funds enabled him to finance an especially well-equipped wagon train that included twenty horses, including two [[Morgan horse|Morgan]] [[Filly|fillies]] and a Morgan [[stallion]] named Black Morrill; their combined value exceeded $3,000. He also purchased two hundred head of red Durham cattle, which he planned to resell in California for profit.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=2–3}} To complete the train, Rose acquired four large ox-drawn [[Covered wagon|prairie schooner]] style [[covered wagon]]s, each required three [[yoke]]s (i.e. six oxen) to pull each wagon.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=4}}  Three wagons were loaded with supplies, and the fourth was used by Alpha Brown and his family. Rose's family traveled in a small wagon that had once been used as an ambulance, which was pulled by a pair of mules.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=4}} {{sfn|Cheney|1915|pp=83–4}}

According to Baley, political and economic factors prompted two Hedgpeth and two Baley families to leave northwestern Missouri for California in early 1858. One factor was the enactment of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]], which admitted Nebraska into the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] as a free territory and granted Kansas the right to decide on the legality of slavery within the state.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=8–11}} The resulting tensions between [[Proslavery|pro-slavery]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] groups fueled conflict near the Missouri state line, affecting its western counties, including Nodaway, where the Baleys and Hedgpeths lived. In Baley's opinion, the financial [[Panic of 1857]] further contributed to instability in the region, driving many mid-westerners to seek a better life in California.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=11}} The combined Baley-Hedgpeth outfits were led by a forty-four-year-old veteran of the [[Black Hawk War]], Gillum Baley, and comprised eight Murphy wagons, sixty-two oxen, seventy-five head of cattle, and several riding horses. They employed half-a-dozen grubstakers to tend their stock.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=11–12}}{{refn|group=nb|Both the Baley and Hedgpeth companies also brought small libraries with them.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=11}}}}

==Journey==
[[File:HerdQuit.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|left|A classic image of the American [[cowboy]], as portrayed by [[Charles Marion Russell|C.M. Russell]]]]

The Rose company left Iowa in April; they traveled to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], then named Westport, which they reached via [[steamboat]] across the [[Missouri River]].{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=5}} In mid-May, they were joined by the Baley company while resting at Cottonwood Creek, near present-day [[Durham, Kansas]].{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=5, 15}} In the interests of safety, the groups agreed to an informal merger; their combined outfits numbered twenty wagons, forty men, fifty to sixty women and children, and nearly five hundred head of [[Livestock branding|unbranded]] cattle.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=15}}

Baley notes that whereas most emigrants who traveled from the [[Midwestern United States]] to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] took the [[Oregon Trail]], in 1858 concerns about the [[Utah War|Mormon War]] led many, including the Rose–Baley Party, to avoid Utah by taking the [[Santa Fe Trail]] to New Mexico, where a viable southern route could then be taken to California.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=1–3, 14–15}}{{refn|group=nb|According to J.W. Cheney, their decision to avoid Utah by taking a southern route added five hundred miles to the trip. Cheney wrote a story about the party in 1915, his material drew heavily from an account given to him by Edward Akey, a member of the Rose company.{{sfn|Cheney|1915|pp=84, 97}}}} The Santa Fe Trail followed the [[Arkansas River]] until it split into two paths near [[Cimarron, Kansas]]. The Mountain Branch continued into the mountains of southern Colorado, and the Cimarron Cutoff avoided mountains, but traversed the fifty-mile-wide Cimarron Desert before the paths met near [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]]. The Cimarron Cutoff was {{convert|100|mi}} shorter and easier to navigate with large wagons, but according to Baley it also led its travelers through the territory of the hostile [[Comanche]] and [[Kiowa]] people. Nonetheless, the Rose–Baley Party chose this path.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=13–14}}{{refn|group=nb|In 1831, famed mountain man [[Jedediah Smith]] was killed by Comanches while taking the Cimarron Cutoff.{{sfn|Groom|2011|p=66}}}}

The wagon train reached [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] on June 23 and prepared for the journey to the Colorado River by way of [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico]], where, despite Udell's lone dissent, they would become the first emigrant train to venture onto Beale's Wagon Road.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=24, 28–37, 39–40}} Udell, writing in his journal, explained his concern: &quot;I thought it was preposterous to start on so long a journey with so many woman and helpless children, and so many dangers attending the attempt.&quot;{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=18}} According to Baley, the emigrants first learned of the recently surveyed road while visiting Albuquerque. Townspeople and army officers, including [[Benjamin Bonneville]], encouraged them to take the new route, which was shorter than the established southern trails by {{convert|200|mi}}, or approximately thirty days travel. They were also told that there was a reliable supply of food and water along the way, and the area was free of hostile Native Americans.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=31, 34}} E.F. Beale was in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the time, making recommendations to members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]:

{{Quote|I regard the establishment of a military post on the Colorado River as an indispensable necessity for the emigrant over this road; for although the Indians living in the rich meadow lands are agricultural, and consequently peaceable, they are very numerous, so much so that we counted 800 men around our camp on the second day after our arrival on the banks of the river. The temptation of scattered emigrant parties with their families, and the confusion of inexperienced teamsters, rafting so wide and rapid a river with their wagons and families, would offer too strong a temptation for the Indians to withstand.{{sfn|Beale|1858|p=3}}}}

Beale suggested that, in addition to a military fort, the route was also in immediate need of bridges and dams to ensure safe travel and provide a reliable water supply; he requested $100,000 to fund the improvements.{{sfn|Beale|1858|pp=1–3}} Further complicating the journey, the only pockets of civilization between Albuquerque and [[San Bernardino, California]], a distance of {{convert|600|mi}}, were the Zuni and [[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]] pueblos.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=29–30}} According to Baley, US Army officers stationed in Albuquerque insisted the emigrants hire Jose Manuel Savedra, a Mexican guide who had traveled with Beale during his initial survey of the route, and his interpreter, Petro.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=30–4}} Unbeknownst to the group, Beale was unhappy with Savedra's scouting abilities, and had demoted him to helping with the animals in the pack train. The Rose–Baley Party paid Savedra's fee of $500 in advance.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=31–3}}

Udell recorded that the Rose–Baley Party left Albuquerque on June 26 and began crossing the [[Rio Grande]] on a [[ferry]]. Three days later, as the last of their outfit crossed, one of Rose's men, Frank Emerdick, drowned in the river.{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=20}} Baley notes that they traveled for the next five days and, because there were no suitable campsites nearby, did not stop to celebrate [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], as would most westbound emigrants. On July 5, they reached the [[Zuni Mountains]], a branch of the [[Rocky Mountains]]; two days later they traversed the [[Continental Divide of the Americas]], which, although {{convert|8000|ft}} to {{convert|9000|ft}} feet in elevation, was a relatively easy passage.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=35–6}} Udell described the road as &quot;smooth and fine, we traveled it in a day with our ox teams, and no hard labor.&quot;{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=23}} On July 7, they camped near [[El Morro National Monument]], then called Inscription Rock, and several members of the party, including Rose and Udell, carved their names into stone&amp;nbsp;– a tradition dating back to 1605.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=37}}{{refn|group=nb|The oldest inscription at El Morro National Monument is that of New Mexico's first Spanish governor, [[Juan de Oñate]], who marked the rock on April 16, 1605.{{sfn|Welsh|Welsh|2000|p=3}}}} Their inscriptions indicated that they were aware of being the first emigrants in the region.{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=24}}

[[File:ZuniPueblo1850.jpg|right|thumb|alt= A pencil drawing of a large Adobe structure|An illustration of Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico, 1850]]

On July 10, the Rose–Baley Party reached Zuni Pueblo, which according to Baley was then home to as many as two thousand agricultural Native Americans. They spent several hours visiting and sightseeing, and the Zuni sold them cornmeal and vegetables, as this was the last such opportunity to purchase supplies until San Bernardino, approximately {{convert|500|mi}} away. According to Baley, this is most likely the first time the Zuni had encountered European women and children, and the first time the emigrants had ever seen people with [[albinism]], which, although rare, was noticeably present in the Zuni population. They left Zuni Pueblo late that afternoon and entered unfamiliar territory that, until now, had only been traversed by Native Americans, explorers, [[Mountain man|mountain men]], and Spanish missionaries. In Baley's opinion, the Rose–Baley Party had previously enjoyed the benefits of a primitive but well-established trail; however, at this point they became the first emigrant wagon train to venture onto the untested Beale's Wagon Road.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=38–40}}

==Beale's Wagon Road==
{{further|Beale's Wagon Road}}
[[File:San Francisco Peaks.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A color image of a mountain|The San Francisco Peaks viewed from atop nearby [[Mount Elden]], elevation 9,301 feet]]

In Baley's opinion, Udell was right to be concerned about the road, and adds: &quot;although Beale had taken a few wagons over the route, [in 1858 it] was little more than a survey trail marked only by faint wagon tracks, an occasional stone cairn, and perhaps a few axe blazes on trees.&quot;{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=29}} Portions of the road followed human and animal trails, and&amp;nbsp;– although potable water was sporadically available&amp;nbsp;– there were also long stretches called ''jornadas'', where it was scarce. From the [[San Francisco Peaks]] to the Colorado River, vital resources were in short supply.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=29–30}}

Because Beale's Wagon Road crossed territory that consisted mainly of the [[Colorado Plateau]]'s rocky high desert, the next water available to the Rose–Baley Party was at a spot named Jacob's Well, located {{convert|36|mi}} west of Zuni Pueblo and {{convert|32|mi}} west of their July 10 campsite. Accordingly, Baley notes that the emigrants were careful to not get lost between watering holes.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=40–1}} Udell recorded that, after traveling for more than half a day, they rested and watered their stock at the well, which produced [[Brackish water|brackish]] but acceptable water. Later that evening, they trekked another {{convert|8|mi}} to [[Navajo Springs, Arizona|Navajo Springs]], where they camped for the night and rested the next day.{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=25–6}}{{refn|group=nb|According to Baley, the party was now entering the domain of the [[Navajo people]], who strongly disliked outsiders in their land. Nevertheless, the emigrants did not see any Navajo in the area, as they passed the warmer months of the year in higher country where they could find plentiful grass for their flocks of sheep.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=41}}}}

[[File:Blue Mesa Painted Desert.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A color image of some desert badlands|Painted desert and petrified logs seen from Blue Mesa, Petrified Forest National Park]]

According to Udell's journal, after Navajo Springs the next available water was {{convert|40|mi}} distant, at the [[Little Colorado River]].{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=26–7}} In between was an area that is now home to [[Petrified Forest National Park]], and several members of the party gathered souvenirs of [[petrified wood]] there.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=41}} They reached the Little Colorado at a spot near present-day [[Holbrook, Arizona]], on July 16, and although the river was brackish and underscored with [[quicksand]], the emigrants were able to secure drinkable water by digging holes in the riverbank that allowed sediment to settle until the water was clear enough for consumption.{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=27}} Next, they followed the river {{convert|85|mi}} to a location that Baley identified as [[Canyon Diablo (canyon)|Canyon Diablo]].{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=41}}

On July 18, Udell recorded that spirits were high amongst the Rose–Baley Party: &quot;Our large company continue to be harmonious, friendly, and kind to each other&amp;nbsp;... General good health prevails&amp;nbsp;... Travel today, {{convert|10|mi}}, and 1,112 from the Missouri River.&quot;{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=28}} The Rose–Baley Party diverged from the Little Colorado River where it meets Canyon Diablo, near present-day [[Winslow, Arizona]]. Uncertain where the next source of clean water was, they decided to camp near the canyon, where they successfully hunted for game while searching for a fresh spring.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=42}}{{refn|group=nb|While camped near Canyon Diablo, several members of the Rose-Baley Party, including Gillum Baley and Amanda Rose, carved their names into Register Rock No. 4.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=43}}}} By the late afternoon of July 24, Savedra returned to camp and reported that they had found water {{convert|17|mi}} away at Walnut Creek, now part of [[Walnut Canyon National Monument]]. They immediately packed up their camp and left, as they were becoming accustomed to evening and night travel, which allowed them to refrain from exertion during the peak heat of the day. They covered {{convert|20|mi}} on July 25 before stopping near a spring in the pine-covered foothills of Arizona's tallest mountains, the San Francisco Peaks, which can be seen for {{convert|100|mi}} in most directions. The range's cool forests gave them a much-needed respite from the intense heat and aridity of the high plains desert.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=43–4}}

[[File:San Francisco Peaks, winter.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A color image of a snow-covered mountain|Humphreys Peak in winter]]

Baley notes that the Rose–Baley Party so enjoyed their camp, near present-day [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], they decided to devote a few extra days to recuperation and sightseeing, and several members of the wagon train climbed [[Humphreys Peak]], which at 12,633 feet is the highest point in Arizona. While climbing the mountain, they came across a large snowfield and were surprised to see snow and ice in late July. Before their descent, they entertained themselves by pushing a massive boulder down the mountainside. Up to this point, the emigrants had enjoyed a primitive but decent road, good small game hunting, and a consistent supply of water, grass, and wood. They had experienced what Baley described as &quot;beautiful and interesting&quot; scenery and encountered only friendly Native Americans; however, a drastic change in these conditions was imminent.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=44}}

According to Baley, on July 29 Savedra informed the Rose–Baley Party, now camped near Leroux Springs, that the next reliable drinking water was seventy or {{convert|80|mi}} away, and there would not be a closer source until the coming rainy season.{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=32–3}} This distance exceeded what most animals could travel without water, and several members of the party were opposed to proceeding any further west until another source had been found.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=45}} Udell disagreed, &quot;I contended that we had better travel on, for, with careful and proper treatment, we could get the stock through to water, and if we remain here until the rainy season, in all human probability our provisions would be exhausted, and we should parish with starvation.&quot;{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=33}} Despite his pleas, nobody wanted to go on until they had located potable water, so six men agreed to undertake a search in hopes that Savedra had overlooked a closer source. Two days later, a man returned to camp and reported that a spring had been found {{convert|15|mi}} west, but its supply was so sparse that it could not meet the needs of the entire wagon train at once. After a thorough debate it was decided that, despite stern warnings from Army officers in Albuquerque against splitting into smaller groups, the best course of action was to divide the train in two and water their stock separately.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=46}}

Udell recorded that on August 1, the Rose company ventured west without the Baley company, who waited one full day before starting out from Leroux Springs. In the meantime, the search party had located enough springs to sustain them for the next {{convert|50|mi}}. Several days later, the party reached their last known source of water, and Savedra informed them that there was not another for {{convert|60|mi}}.{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=33–4, 35}} Because that was too long for their animals to travel without water, the party decided to backtrack approximately {{convert|26|mi}} to the location of the last reliable supply at Cataract Creek.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=47}} Udell again protested to no avail, recording in his journal that night: &quot;Had there been a road that I could have traveled without a guide, I should have gone on and risked the consequences.&quot;{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=35–6}} Having trekked {{convert|52|mi}} without clean water, the party's stock had grown extremely thirsty. The supply at Cataract Canyon was limited, and it contained what Udell called &quot;wigglers&quot;; however, they had no choice but to drink from, and allow their animals to drink from, the less than ideal source. By August 9, the Rose–Baley Party had begun to lose confidence in Savedra's ability to find water, and had been forced to do their own scouting for the precious resource. They had taken to building [[Barrel|casks]] out of pine in hopes that they could gather enough in containers to last them until the next acceptable supply. Udell wrote, &quot;Our water still holds out&amp;nbsp;... like the widow's cruse of oil, and tastes more pleasant, having been stirred up so often for us.&quot;{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=36–7}}

On August 13, Udell noted that the area received a substantial rainfall that marginally eased the Rose–Baley Party's concerns regarding the scarcity of water in the region. Later that evening, the men who had been searching for it during the last five days returned to camp and reported that they had found an acceptable source {{convert|40|mi}} distant and another {{convert|80|mi}} away.{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=37–8}} The emigrants spent the next morning filling casks and preparing for travel; they left late that afternoon, and after having trekked continuously for nearly twenty-four hours arrived at Partridge Creek the next day. That night a thunderstorm filled the creek with rainwater, further easing their concerns; however, after traveling {{convert|20|mi}} the following day, they realized that the recent rainfalls has not reached that far, forcing them to make a dry camp on August 17.{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=38–9}}

[[File:Two young Walapai Indian mothers with their children on their backs, Hackbury, Arizona, ca.1900 (CHS-3176).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|alt=A black and white photograph of two Native American women with children in backpacks|Two Hualapai mothers with children on their backs, Hackbury, Arizona, c. 1900]]

On August 18, after having traveled the last {{convert|85|mi}} without reliable grass or water, the Rose–Baley Party located a field and a spring that were sufficient to satisfy their stock. That night, despite posting round-the-clock guards, a mare and a mule went missing, and three searchers were sent to find them. They tracked the animals to a deep canyon, where Native Americans hiding in the rocks shot arrows at them. Savedra noticed the Natives watching the party from the nearby foothills the following day, and was able to draw them into camp using sign language. In Baley's opinion, the Natives were most likely [[Hualapai]]. They could speak a few words of Spanish and English, and Savedra was able to communicate with them using their dialect and sign language. They admitted to having the group's missing animals, but insisted that the Mohave had stolen them. They repeatedly thumped their chest while uttering, &quot;Hanna, Hanna&quot;, meaning &quot;good&quot; Native, insisting that the Mohave were &quot;bad&quot; Natives.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=50–1}}

According to Rose, Savedra knew that the Mohave rarely ventured this far from their homelands, so they assumed the Hualapai had taken the animals, which were returned the following morning as the party camped at [[Peach Springs, Arizona|Peach Springs]].{{sfn|Rose|1941|pp=307–8}} The animals were led back by twenty-five Natives hoping for compensation in return, as Udell explained: &quot;It was soon evident that they expected very extravagant rewards, all expecting shoes, clothing, and trinkets, besides some cattle&amp;nbsp;... many remained in camp with us that night, doubtless for the purpose of stealing, but the guard kept so sharp a lookout that they found no opportunity.&quot;{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=50–1}} On August 20, the party awoke to another fifty Hualapai anticipating gifts in exchange for the return of the stolen animals. The Natives left around noon, after receiving tobacco, trinkets, and food, but the emigrants noticed that six oxen were missing. A search team located four carcasses that had been stripped of their flesh; the other two animals were found nearby, having been recently killed, but not yet butchered. That night, the Rose–Baley Party decided to once again split their wagon train in response to the scarcity of water. According to Baley, as they journeyed from their campsite at Peach Springs to the Colorado River more than {{convert|100|mi}} away, they were almost continuously harassed by Natives, who sent arrows flying into their wagon train during the day and raided their camp at night.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=51–3}}

==Colorado River==
Udell recorded that in the late afternoon of August 27, 1858, the Rose–Baley Party reached the [[Black Mountains (Arizona)|Black Mountains]]. They made their crossing at Sitgreaves Pass, elevation 3,652 feet and named after Lieutenant Lorenzo Sitgreaves, who led an expedition party to the region in 1851. From the crest they could see the Colorado River in the distance.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=56}} Having traveled all night and worked continuously during the morning and afternoon, the Rose–Baley Party stopped to prepare their first meal of the day. Soon afterward, a small group of Mohave warriors approached and asked, in a combination of broken English and Spanish, how many people their wagon train included and whether they intended to permanently settle near the Colorado River. The Mohave, who appeared friendly and had brought with them corn and melons, which they sold to the emigrants, were promised that the wagon train planned to travel through the region en route to their intended destination in Southern California. This seemed to appease the Natives, many of whom helped the party during their decent down the western slope of the Black Mountains to the Colorado River below.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=59}} The emigrants were now entering Mohave country, near present-day [[Needles, California]].{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=56, 58}}

[[File:Mohave Indians.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white photograph of two Mohave men next to the Colorado River, 1871|Two Mohave men next to the Colorado River, 1871]]

By midnight, the Baley company had fallen behind the Rose company and decided to stop and make a mountain camp while Rose and others continued to the Colorado River, where they planned to water their combined stock and build a raft in preparation for the impending river crossing. By noon on August 28, Rose had reached a patch of Cottonwood trees about one mile from the river, where their oxen were unhitched and allowed to join the loose stock racing towards the water. There the emigrants encountered more Mohave, but unlike the friendly ones that greeted them at Sitgreaves Pass, these were rude and hostile. After a thorough watering, the work oxen were returned to the wagons.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=61}} Rose and his wife, Amanda, decided to scout the river bank for a suitable campsite, exiting their wagon to make the journey by foot. Moments later, an aggressive Mohave placed his hand on her shoulder and bosom, and she ran back, terrified, to the relative safety of their wagon. Rose, not wanting to incite the Mohave, ignored the incident and continued to the river. Other Mohave harassed Alpha Brown's family, briefly threatening to take his wife's dress and abduct their son. That danger was averted, but many Mohave set about driving off and slaughtering several of the party's cattle before leaving the emigrants alone at their encampment, some two hundred yards from the river and {{convert|10|mi}} away from the Baley company's mountain camp.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=61–2}}

The following morning, they moved their camp to the river bank to facilitate easier watering of their stock. They were visited around noon by twenty-five warriors and a Mohave sub-chief, who heard their complaints about the killing of their livestock and assured them that no further depredations would occur, and that they could cross the Colorado as they pleased. About one hour later, another chief and several warriors approached the camp; after receiving gifts, they also left without incident.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=63–4}} According to Rose, upon hearing of the emigrants plans the chief gave them, &quot;a very searching look, as if not half believing it&quot;.{{sfn|Rose|1859|p=312}} By noon, the party had moved their camp still closer to where they planned to cross, about a mile downriver near a patch of cottonwood trees that were suitable for building rafts.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=63–4}}

==Mohave attack==
According to Baley, at approximately 2 p.m. on August 30, 1858, the emigrants camped near the Colorado River heard Alpha Brown's step-daughter, [[Sallie Fox]], screaming. She had been playing in a wagon when she noticed several Mohave nearby. Having lost the element of surprise, three hundred warriors then let out [[Battle cry|war whoops]] as they shot arrows into the camp, mortally wounding Rose's foreman, Alpha Brown.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=67–9}} Udell described the attack as &quot;like a shower&quot; of arrows.{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=45}} According to Rose, &quot;I have no doubt they expected to massacre us. But we were well armed and the men that were in camp ready to receive them.&quot;{{sfn|Rose|1941|p=312}} As the men mounted a defense, the women ran with their children to the covered wagons.{{sfn|Woodward|1953|p=69}} Both Udell and Rose stated that the fighting lasted for approximately two hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1941|p=312}}; {{harvnb|Udell|1946|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baley explains that when a Mohave chief who appeared to be leading the attack stepped out in front of his warriors and taunted the emigrants, Gillum Baley, a veteran of the Black Hawk War and a noted marksman, took him down with a single rifle shot. The Mohave warriors then retrieved the chief's body and retreated from the battle.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=70–1}}

According to Udell, eight members of the Rose-Baley party had been killed and thirteen wounded.{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=46}} Rose stated that of the train's livestock, only ten horses and seventeen cattle remained.{{sfn|Rose|1941|p=313}} Baley notes that in addition to the killing of Alpha Brown, the entirety of the seven-member Bentner family, including five children, were massacred while traveling unaccompanied from Baley's mountain camp to Rose's river camp.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=5, 71}}{{refn|group=nb|According to Baley, when the Bentner family wagon was located, the eldest daughter's naked body was found nearby; her face had been mutilated. The other Bentners were never found; however, Mohave warriors had taunted the emigrants near the river with a long pole with several [[Scalping|scalps]] attached, which the Rose-Baley Party assumed had come from the Bentners.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=67}}}} However subsequent investigations showed that the Bentner's were attacked by a group of Hualapais including 7 renegade Mohave warriors.{{sfn|Sherer|1994|page=82-84}} The emigrants killed approximately seventeen Mohave warriors.{{sfn|Zappia|2014|p=129}} In the opinion of the cultural anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], &quot;the event sealed the fate of the Mohave as an independent people.&quot;{{sfn|Kroeber|Kroeber|1973|p=53}} In 1859, the US military established [[Fort Mohave]] near the location of the battle at Beale's Crossing.{{sfn|Shepherd|2010|p=31}}

==Aftermath==
When the battle had ended, and the Mohave retreated, the Rose company gathered to discuss their options. Being low on ammunition and manpower, the emigrants were not confident in their ability to hold off another attack. So, although San Bernardino, at about {{convert|170|mi}} away was much closer, they unanimously decided to backtrack the nearly {{convert|500|mi}} to Albuquerque. Because they were dangerously low on supplies, their successful return to Albuquerque was partly contingent upon finding assistance from west-bound emigrants. Before beginning the return trip, they wrapped Alpha Brown's body in chains and committed it to the Colorado River. With only one remaining wagon and the ambulance, they decided which items they could carry and which they should abandon. Those who were able rode horses, and the rest walked.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=72–4}}

{{quote box|quote= This day all who were left alive of Mr. Rose's party came into camp, bringing melancholy intelligence.{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=45}}|source=&amp;nbsp;—Udell's journal, August 31, 1858 |width=33%|align=right|style=padding:10px;}}

At approximately 6 p.m., with the wounded in one wagon, the children in the ambulance, and the healthy adults on foot, the Rose company began the difficult journey back to Albuquerque, during which, according to the author Arthur Woodward, they observed a fiery comet that further upset the already frightened children.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baley|2002|pp=72–4}}: the distance from the mountain camp to Albuquerque was approximately {{convert|500|mi}}; {{harvnb|Woodward|1953|p=58}}: the Rose-Baley Party observed a fiery comet that further upset the already frightened children.&lt;/ref&gt; By 10 p.m. the party began to hear war whoops and the clanging of pots and pans coming from the direction of the Colorado River. Baley suggests that the Mohave had returned to &quot;finish them off&quot;, but after finding a large cache of supplies celebrated their windfall, which included Rose's eight-dollar-a-bottle brandy. In Baley's opinion, the newfound spoils were likely the only reason the Mohave didn't follow the fleeing wagon train, now en route to rendezvous with the Baley company at their mountain camp.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=74–6}}

{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Concepts}}

'''Feminism in the United States''' refers to the collection of movements and ideologies aimed at defining, establishing, and defending a state of [[feminism and equality|equal]] political, economic, cultural, and social [[women's rights|rights for women]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feminism |title=Feminism – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=merriam-webster.com |accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/feminism |title=Definition of feminism noun from Cambridge Dictionary Online: Free English Dictionary and Thesaurus |publisher=dictionary.cambridge.org |accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feminism in the United States is often divided chronologically into [[first-wave feminism|first-wave]], [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]], and [[third-wave feminism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://womenshistory.answers.com/feminism/what-are-the-three-waves-of-feminism|title = What Are the Three Waves of Feminism?|date = |accessdate = June 30, 2014|website = Answers|publisher = |last = Engel|first = Kerilynn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the most recent [[Gender Gap Index]] measurement of countries by the [[World Economic Forum]] in 2014, the United States is ranked 20th on gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/india-slides-gender-equality-global-ranking-26501431|title=India Slides, US Gains in Gender Equality Ranking|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First-wave Feminism==
The [[History of feminism#First-wave feminism|first wave of feminism in the United States]] began with the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first women's rights convention, held at the Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls, New York, on July 19 and 20, 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoJrHDirVQUC&amp;pg=PA12 |title=Encyclopedia of women and religion&amp;nbsp;... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011|isbn=9780253346865|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Convention was inspired by the fact that in 1840, when [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] met [[Lucretia Mott]] at the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in London, the conference refused to seat Mott and other women delegates from America because of their gender.&lt;ref name=&quot;npg.si.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.si.edu/col/seneca/senfalls1.htm |title=seneca falls |publisher=Npg.si.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanton, the young bride of an antislavery agent, and Mott, a Quaker preacher and veteran of reform, talked then of calling a convention to address the condition of women.&lt;ref name=&quot;npg.si.edu&quot;/&gt;

An estimated three hundred people attended the convention, including notables Lucretia Mott and Frederick Douglass.&lt;ref name=&quot;npg.si.edu&quot;/&gt; At the conclusion, 68 women and 32 men signed the [[Declaration of Sentiments]], which was written by  [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and the [[Thomas M'Clintock|M'Clintock family]].&lt;ref name=&quot;npg.si.edu&quot;/&gt;

The style and format of the Declaration of Sentiments was that of the [[Declaration of Independence]]. For example, the Declaration of Sentiments stated, &quot;We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men and women are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rochester.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochester.edu/SBA/suffrage_sba_ecs.html |title=The Susan B. Anthony Center for Women's Leadership :: Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton |publisher=Rochester.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration further stated, &quot;The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man towards woman.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rochester.edu&quot;/&gt;

The declaration went on to specify female grievances in regard to the laws denying married women ownership of wages, money, and property (all of which they were required to turn over to their husbands; laws requiring this, in effect throughout America, were called coverture laws), women's lack of access to education and professional careers, and the lowly status accorded women in most churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;rochester.edu&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, the Declaration declared that women should have the right to vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;rochester.edu&quot;/&gt;

Some of the participants at Seneca Falls organized the [[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|Rochester Women's Rights Convention]] two weeks later on August 2 in Rochester, New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/wori/historyculture/womens-rights-movement.htm |title=Women's Rights National Historical Park – Women's Rights Movement (U.S. National Park Service) |publisher=Nps.gov |date=August 17, 2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by other state and local conventions in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov&quot;/&gt; The first [[National Woman's Rights Convention]] was held in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1850.&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov&quot;/&gt; Women's rights conventions were held regularly from 1850 until the start of the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy98.org/move-hist.html |title=Legacy '98: A Short History of the Movement |publisher=Legacy98.org |date=September 19, 2001 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]] began with the 1848 [[Seneca Falls Convention]]; many of the activists became politically aware during the abolitionist movement. The movement reorganized after the Civil War, gaining experienced campaigners, many of who had worked for prohibition in the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]]. By the end of the 19th century only a few western states had granted women full voting rights,&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca J. Mead, ''How the Vote Was Won: Woman Suffrage in the Western United States, 1868–1914'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; though women had made significant legal victories, gaining rights in areas such as property and child custody.&lt;ref&gt;Glenda Riley, ''Inventing the American Woman: An Inclusive History'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony formed the [[American Equal Rights Association]], an organization for white and black women and men dedicated to the goal of suffrage for all.&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/naw/nawstime.html |title=Votes for Women: Timeline |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |date=August 26, 1920 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868 the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, this was the first Amendment to ever specify the voting population as &quot;male&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; In 1869 the women's rights movement split into two factions as a result of disagreements over the Fourteenth and soon-to-be-passed Fifteenth Amendments, with the two factions not reuniting until 1890.&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony formed the more radical, New York-based National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA).&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; [[Lucy Stone]], [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]], and [[Julia Ward Howe]] organized the more conservative American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which was centered in Boston.&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; In 1870 the Fifteenth Amendment enfranchised black men.&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; NWSA refused to work for its ratification, arguing, instead, that it be &quot;scrapped&quot; in favor of a Sixteenth Amendment providing universal suffrage.&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; Frederick Douglass broke with Stanton and Anthony over NWSA's position.&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;

In 1869 Wyoming became the first territory or state in America to grant women suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/wyoming-grants-women-the-vote Wyoming grants women the vote — History.com This Day in History — 12/10/1869&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870 [[Louisa Ann Swain]] became the first woman in the United States to vote in a [[General election (U.S.)|general election]]. She cast her ballot on September 6, 1870, in [[Laramie, Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Women vote in the West: the Woman Suffrage Movement, 1869&amp;ndash;1896 |first= Beverly Beeton |publisher= [[Garland Science]] |location= New York |year= 1986 |isbn= 978-0-8240-8251-2 |pages= |page= 11 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Women and museums: a comprehensive guide |first= Victor J. |last= Danilov |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|AltaMira Press]] |location= Lanham, MD |year= 2005 |isbn= 978-0-7591-0854-7 |pages= |page= 68 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4AWmyJvZwkwC&amp;pg=PA68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1870 to 1875 several women, including [[Virginia Louisa Minor]], [[Victoria Woodhull]], and [[Myra Bradwell]], attempted to use the Fourteenth Amendment in the courts to secure the vote (Minor and Woodhull) or the right to practice law (Bradwell), but they were all unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; In 1872 Susan B. Anthony was arrested and brought to trial in Rochester, New York, for attempting to vote for Ulysses S. Grant in the presidential election; she was convicted and fined $100 and the costs of her prosecution but refused to pay.&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doug Linder |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/anthony/timeline.html |title=The Susan B. Anthony Trial: A Chronology |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Sojourner Truth]] appeared at a polling booth in Battle Creek, Michigan, demanding a ballot; she was turned away.&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; Also in 1872, Victoria Woodhull became the first woman to run for president, although she could not vote and only received a few votes, losing to Ulysses S. Grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/wiseguide/may06/women.html |title=The LOC.GOV Wise Guide : The First Woman to Run for President&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. 50 Years Ago? |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was nominated to run by the Equal Rights Party, and advocated the [[Eight-hour day|8-hour work day]], graduated income tax, social welfare programs, and profit sharing, among other positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://victoria-woodhull.com/whoisvw.htm |title=Who Is Victoria Woodhull? |publisher=Victoria-woodhull.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) was founded by [[Annie Wittenmyer]] to work for the prohibition of alcohol; with [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] at its head (starting in 1876), the WCTU also became an important force in the fight for women's suffrage.&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; In 1878 a woman suffrage amendment was first introduced in the United States Congress, but it did not pass.&lt;ref name=&quot;memory.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/amendment_19/ |title=Featured Document: The 19th Amendment |publisher=Archives.gov |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] was ratified, giving women the right to vote; the first wave of feminism is considered to have ended with that victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

[[Margaret Higgins Sanger]],  was one of the first American birth control activists. She was also a sex educator, writer, and nurse. She popularized the term &quot;birth control&quot;,  opened the first birth control clinic in the United States in 1916, and established organizations that evolved into the [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]].

==Second-wave feminism==
[[Second-wave feminism]] in the United States began in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.awoman.org/secondwave.html|title = Second Wave Feminist|date = Jan 2014|accessdate = June 30, 2014|website = Association of Women Professionals|publisher = Association of Women Professionals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 [[Betty Friedan]], influenced by ''[[The Second Sex]]'', wrote the bestselling book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' in which she explicitly objected to the mainstream media image of women, stating that placing women at home limited their possibilities, and wasted talent and potential. The perfect [[nuclear family]] image depicted and strongly marketed at the time, she wrote, did not reflect happiness and was rather degrading for women.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Cynthia Fuchs. 1988. ''Deceptive Distinctions: Sex, Gender, and the Social Order''. New Haven: Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; This book is widely credited with having begun second-wave feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/betty-friedan-465800.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Corinne | last=Sweet | title=Betty Friedan | date=February 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1963, freelance journalist [[Gloria Steinem]] gained widespread popularity among feminists after a diary she authored while working undercover as a [[Playboy Bunny]] waitress at the [[Playboy Club]] was published as a two-part feature in the May and June issues of ''Show''.&lt;ref name=steinfem&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sixties Chronicle|author=David Farber|publisher=Legacy Publishing|page=150|year=2004|isbn=141271009X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature was &quot;A Bunny's Tale&quot; ([http://dlib.nyu.edu/undercover/sites/dlib.nyu.edu.undercover/files/documents/uploads/editors/Show-A%20Bunny%27s%20Tale-Part%20One-May%201963.pdf Part I] and [http://dlib.nyu.edu/undercover/sites/dlib.nyu.edu.undercover/files/documents/uploads/editors/Show-A%20Bunny%27s%20Tale-Part%20Two-June%201963.pdf Part II].) Steinem alleged the club was mistreating its waitresses in order to gain male customers and exploited the Playboy Bunnies as symbols of male chauvinism, noting that the club's manual instructed the Bunnies that &quot;there are many pleasing ways they can employ to stimulate the club's liquor volume.&quot;&lt;ref name=steinfem /&gt; By 1968, Steinem had become arguably the most influential figure in the movement and support for legalized abortion and free daycares had become the two leading objectives for feminists.&lt;ref name=steinfem2&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sixties Chronicle|author=David Farber|publisher=Legacy Publishing|page=377|year=2004|isbn=141271009X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement grew with legal victories such as the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] (which banned sex discrimination in employment), and the ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling of 1965 (which legalized birth control for married couples.)  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Climbing the Academic Ladder: Doctoral Women Scientists in Academe : a Report to the Office of Science and Technology Policy from the Committee on the Education and Employment of Women in Science and Engineering, Commission on Human Resources, National Research Council|last = Hornig|first = Lilli S.|publisher = National Academy of Sciences|date = Jan 1, 1979|isbn = 0309028809|location = Washington DC|pages = 135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;archives.gov&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/civil-rights-act/|title = Teaching With Documents: The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|date = |accessdate = July 12, 2014|website = National Archives and Records Administration Website|publisher = National Archives and Records Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the most significant legal victories of the movement in the 1960s after the formation of NOW were a 1967 Executive Order extending full affirmative action rights to women, a 1968 [[EEOC]] decision ruling illegal sex-segregated help wanted ads, and the legalization of [[no-fault divorce]] (although not legalized in all states until 2010).

The movement picked up more victories in the 1970s. The [[Title X]] Family Planning Program, officially known as Public Law 91-572 or “Population Research and Voluntary Family Planning Programs” was enacted under President Richard Nixon in 1970 as part of the Public Health Service Act; it is the only federal grant program dedicated solely to providing individuals with comprehensive family planning and related preventive health services. The Supreme Court case ''[[Reed v. Reed]]'' (1971), was the case in which the Supreme Court for the first time applied the Equal Protection Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] to strike down a law that discriminated against women.&lt;ref name=&quot;archives.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nwlc.org/resource/reed-v-reed-40-landmark-decision|title = Reed v.

The criminalization of [[marital rape]] in the United States started in the mid-1970s and by 1993 marital rape became a crime in all 50 states, under at least one section of the sexual offense codes. In 1978 the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act]] was enacted; it is a [[United States federal statute]] which amended [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VII|Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] to &quot;prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/pregnancy.cfm Text of the Act from the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

A major disappointment of the second-wave feminist movement in the United States was President Nixon's 1972 veto of the [[Comprehensive Child Development Bill of 1972]], which would have provided a multibillion-dollar national day care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113009/child-care-america-was-very-close-universal-day-care|title=Child Care: America was very close to universal day care - New Republic|author=Nancy L.

The feminist movement in the late 1970s, led by NOW, briefly attempted a program to help older divorced and widowed women. Many widows were ineligible for Social Security benefits, few divorcees actually received any alimony, and after a career as a housewife, few had skills to enter the labor force.  The program, however, encountered sharp criticism from young activists who gave priority to poor minority women rather than the middle class. By 1980, NOW downplayed the program as it focused almost exclusively on the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). [[Phyllis Schlafly]], the conservative leader, moved into the vacuum. She denounced the feminists for abandoning older middle-class widows and divorcees in need,  and warned that ERA would equalize the laws for the benefit of men, stripping protections that older women urgently needed.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Levenstein, &quot;'Don't Agonize, Organize!': The Displaced Homemakers Campaign and the Contested Goals of Postwar Feminism.&quot; 'Journal of American History'' (2014) 100#4: 1114-1138. [http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/100/4/1114.short online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main disappointment of the second wave feminist movement in the United States was the failure to ratify the  federal Equal Rights Amendment. It states, &quot;Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tavanna&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://tavaana.org/en/content/1960s-70s-american-feminist-movement-breaking-down-barriers-women|title = The 1960s-70s American Feminist Movement: Breaking Down Barriers for Women |date = |accessdate = July 12, 2014|website = https://tavaana.org|publisher = E-Collaborative for Civic Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;equalrightsamendment&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/overview.htm|title = The Equal Rights Amendment Unfinished Business for the Constitution |date =  |accessdate = July 12, 2014|website = http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment expired in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/socrevera.htm|title=Social Revolution and the Equal Rights Amendment|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historians view the second wave feminist era in America as ending in the early 1980s with the [[Feminist Sex Wars]], a split within the movement over issues such as sexuality and pornography. These disputes ushered in the era of [[third-wave feminism]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=Duggan&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Duggan, Lisa |author2=Hunter, Nan D. |title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-91036-6|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{Cite book|author=Hansen, Karen Tranberg|author2=Philipson, Ilene J. |title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader|year=1990|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-87722-630-X |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gerhard, Jane F.|title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982|year=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11204-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt&gt;{{Cite book|author=Leidholdt, Dorchen|authorlink=Dorchen Leidholdt|author2=Raymond, Janice G |title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism|year=1990|publisher=Pergamon Press|location=New York|isbn=0-08-037457-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance&gt;{{Cite book|author=Vance, Carole S|title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality|publisher=Thorsons Publishers|isbn=0-04-440593-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third-wave Feminism==
Third-wave feminism in the United States began in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dicker&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dicker|first=Rory|title=A History of U.S. Feminisms|year=2008|publisher=[[Seal Press]]|location=Berkeley, CA |asin= B004KPLWGM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CatchingAWave&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|editor1= Dicker, Piepmeier|editor2=Rory, Alison|title=Catching a Wave: Reclaiming Feminism for the 21st Century|year=2003|publisher=Northeastern|location=Boston, MA|isbn= 978-1555535704}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, [[Anita Hill]] accused [[Clarence Thomas]], a man nominated to the [[United States Supreme Court]], of [[sexual harassment]].

The organization’s initial mission was to fill a void in young women’s leadership and to mobilize young people to become more involved socially and politically in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Third Wave Foundation |url=http://www.thirdwavefoundation.org/about-us/history/ |title=History |publisher=Third Wave Foundation |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the early 1990s, the [[riot grrrl]] movement began in [[Olympia, Washington]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]; it sought to give women the power to control their voices and artistic expressions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowe-Finbeiner&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The F-Word |last=Rowe-Finkbeiner |first=Kristin |year=2004 |publisher=[[Seal Press]] |location=[[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] |isbn=978-1-58005-114-9 |url= |accessdate=| oclc=55504351}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Riot grrrl's emphasis on universal female identity and separatism often appears more closely allied with second-wave feminism than with the third wave.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg_Garofalo&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Jessica |last2=Garofalo |first2=Gitana |year=1998 |title=Riot Grrrl: Revolutions from Within |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=23 |issue=3: Feminisms and Youth Cultures |pages=809–841 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |doi=10.1086/495289 |url= |accessdate= |oclc=486795617 |issn=0097-9740 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-wave feminists sought to question, reclaim, and redefine the ideas, words, and media that have transmitted ideas about gender, gender roles, womanhood, beauty, and sexuality, among other things.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/724633/feminism/280084/Foundations|title=Feminism (sociology)|work=Encyclopedia Britannica |author=Laura Brunell|date=May 13, 2007 |accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-wave feminism saw many new feminist icons such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Emma Watson]], [[Beyonce]], and [[Lady Gaga]], as well as fictional characters such as [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer|Buffy]] and [[Mulan (Disney character)|Mulan]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Third-wave feminists have recently utilized the Internet and other modern technology to enhance their movement, which has allowed for information and organization to reach a larger audience. This larger audience has also expanded to many male celebrities such as [[Aziz Ansari]] and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]].

Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like Susan McClary, Marcia Citron and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and education of women; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.[160]

== Criticisms ==
Critics of mainstream feminist discourse point to the white-washed historical narrative that omits and/or minimizes the roles played by women of color within and without the feminist movement, as well as the differing obstacles faced by women of color. [[Audre Lorde]], Caribbean-American feminist and essayist, stated: &quot;What woman here is so enamored of her own oppression that she cannot see her heel print upon another woman's face? What woman’s terms of oppression have become precious and necessary to her as a ticket into the fold of the righteous, away from the cold winds of self-scrutiny? . . . We welcome all women who can meet us, face to face, beyond objectification and beyond guilt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mariana Ortega, &quot;Being Lovingly, Knowingly Ignorant: White Feminism and Women of Color,&quot; Hypatia 1/23 (2006): 56&lt;/ref&gt;

These historical omissions are particularly evident in accounts on First-Wave feminism which often ignores the roles played by fundamental activists such as [[Ida Bell Wells-Barnett]]. Wells-Barnett was a key figure in the early feminist movement, her form of radical protest politics &quot;recognized the limits of racial uplift and acknowledged the power of political action in the form of direct protest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Crystal N. Feimster, Southern Horrors (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2009),212&lt;/ref&gt; For most of her career, Wells-Barnett faced opposition from white feminist leaders such as [[Rebecca Latimer Felton]] and [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]], the first woman to serve in the United States Senate and a former president of the WCTU respectively, who saw the feminist movement as an Anglo Saxon pursuit and built their rhetoric on the ideology of white supremacy: &quot;The Anglo-Saxon race,&quot; Willard wrote, &quot;will never submit to be dominated by the Negro so long as his altitude reaches no higher than the personal liberty of the saloon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Crystal N.Feimster, Southern Horrors (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2009), 82&lt;/ref&gt; Wells-Barnett's radical activist tactics were later adopted by women's organizations and feminist movements of the early period who recognized the utility of radicalism in achieving legislative change. However, Wells-Barnett's achievements and influences on the First-Wave of the feminist movement are absent in mainstream discussions.

These criticisms stretch into second- and third-wave feminism, which is dominated by narratives  minimizing the role of women of color while celebrating achievements as a whole through the gaze of white female leaders. Consequently, by the 1970s and 1980s, African-American women, such as [[bell hooks]], developed a social consciousness by publicly voicing dissatisfaction with black women's representation in feminist discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Hill Collins, &quot;What's In A Name? Womanism, Black Feminism, and Beyond,&quot; The Black Scholar 21/6 (Winter/Spring 1996): 9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Columbia Rediviva''''' (commonly known as the '''''Columbia''''') was a privately owned [[Full rigged ship|ship]] under the command of [[John Kendrick (American sea captain)|John Kendrick]], along with [[Robert Gray (sea-captain)|Captain Robert Gray]], best known for going to the [[Pacific Northwest]]  for the [[maritime fur trade]]. The &quot;Rediviva&quot; (''Latin'' &quot;revived&quot;) was added to her name upon a rebuilding in 1787. Since ''Columbia'' was privately owned, she did not carry the prefix designation &quot;[[United States Navy ships|USS]]&quot;.

Later historians say she was built in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]]  in 1787.
In 1790 she became the first American ship to circumnavigate the globe. During the first part of this voyage, she was accompanied by the ''[[Lady Washington]]'' which served as [[Ship's tender|tender]] for the ''Columbia''. In 1792 Captain Gray [[Gray Sails the Columbia River|entered]] the [[Columbia River]] and named it after the ship. The river and [[Columbia Basin|its basin]], in turn, lent its name to [[Columbia District|the surrounding region]], and subsequently to [[Colony of British Columbia|the British colony]] and [[British Columbia|Canadian province]] located in part of this region.

The ship was decommissioned and salvaged in 1806. A replica of ''Lady Washington'' is located at [[Grays Harbor Historical Seaport]] in [[Aberdeen, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalseaport.org Grays Harbor Historical Seaport]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of pharmacy in the United States''' is the story of a melting pot of new pharmaceutical ideas and innovations drawn from advancements that Europeans shared, [[Native American medicine]] and newly discovered medicinal plants in the [[New World]].  American pharmacy grew from this fertile mixture, and has impacted U.S. history, and the [[history of pharmacy|global course of pharmacy]].

'''[[Apothecaries|Apothecary]]'''—an ancient title that, especially in pre-modern or [[early modern]] contexts, indicates a broader set of skills and duties than the core role of dispensing medications, like prescribing remedies and even giving some treatments difficult to self-administer, [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bosse_Apotechary.jpg e.g. enemas]—have largely been within the &quot;pharmacist&quot; umbrella in the U.S. since the mid-19th century, when [[Edward Parrish]] of the [[American Pharmaceutical Association]] successfully proposed that the APhA &quot;consider all the varied pharmaceutical practitioners 'pharmacists'” to better &quot;standardize the field.&quot;&lt;ref name=STLCOP&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Pharmacy|url=https://www.stlcop.edu/practice/history/|publisher=St. Louis College of Pharmacy|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Unlike in [[the UK]], where pharmacists were [[Apothecaries Act of 1815|separated from apothecaries by Parliament]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Pharmaceutical&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Pharmacy|url=http://www.rpharms.com/about-pharmacy/history-of-pharmacy.asp|publisher=Royal Pharmaceutical Society|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pharmacist had effectively eclipsed the ancient apothecary, appellations and professions have been far more fluid and overlapping in the U.S.,&lt;ref name=Cowen110/&gt; especially prior to the regulatory schemes widely adopted in the late 19th century.  &quot;Apothecary&quot; still crops up as synonym for pharmacist, along with &quot;druggist,&quot; and has yet to fall entirely out of use, with some in the U.S. still calling themselves apothecaries.&lt;ref name=kelly1/&gt;  As the pharmacist increasingly became the distinct discipline and tightly-defined profession it is today, American pharmacists added their own discoveries and innovations, and played a prominent role in the revolution in medical knowledge in the 19th and 20th centuries and the subsequent development of modern medicine.

The history of pharmacy has lagged behind other fields in the [[history of science]] and [[History of medicine in the United States|medicine]], perhaps because primary sources in the field are sparse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Swann|2009|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historical inquiries in this area have been few, and unlike the growing number of programs in the [[history of medicine]], history of pharmacy programs remain few in number in the United States.&lt;ref name=PCPmuseum&gt;{{cite web|title=Marvin Samson Center for the History of Pharmacy {{!}} University of the Sciences|url=http://www.usciences.edu/museum|publisher=University of the Sciences|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial period==

===Early developments alongside colonization===
As soon as [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] started his explorations of the Americas in the late 15th century, a European effort to find valuable medicinal plants among the flora of the [[New World]] to add to the medical canon got underway.  Early New World medicines uncovered included [[guaiacum]] from the West Indies (for coughs, rheumatism and a wide variety of other uses), [[sassafras]] from Florida, [[copaiba]] from Brazil, [[Peru balsam]]  and, most famously, [[cinchona bark]] from Peru,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kremers and Sonnedecker|1986|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called &quot;[[Jesuit's bark]]&quot; in honor of its discoverer, which became the first effective treatment for malaria.  The active ingredient of this cinchona bark, [[quinine]], was the primary treatment for malaria well into the 1940s.  &quot;About 170 drugs used by the Indians of British North America, and perhaps 50 used by the indigenous people of the Caribbean, Mexico, Central and South America&quot; became important enough in the U.S. (as the practitioners of chemistry and pharmacy eventually catalogued, analyzed and understood them) to merit listing in the United States Pharmacopoeia (est. 1820)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usp.org/about-usp/our-impact/mission-history# | title=Mission &amp; History - U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention | accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the National Formulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kremers and Sonnedecker|1986|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1700s, [[James Oglethorpe]], founder of the [[Georgia colony]], with the financial backing of the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries of London]] and others, launched an effort to identify and transplant beneficial plant species from the tropical colonies to Savannah, Georgia.  Unfortunately for Oglethorpe (and all the Southern colonists) the expedition that marked this first attempt by an organized group of [[Old World]] apothecaries to benefit from [[British North America]]'s potential as a medicine farm never bore fruit.  The Caribbean expedition's lead investigator, botanist Robert Miller, was hampered by illness and uncooperative Spanish colonials, and all support from London ceased when Miller died without much success.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kremers and Sonnedecker|1986|pp=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmacy in eighteenth century North America===
The first &quot;drugstores&quot; in North America &quot;appeared in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia,&quot;&lt;ref name=kelly2&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; with likely proto-drugstores—for example Gysbert van Imbroch ran a &quot;general store&quot; that sold drugs from 1663-1665 in Wildwyck, New Netherland,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kremers151&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kremers and Sonnedecker|1986|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; today's [[Kingston, New York]]—preceding the dedicated apothecary shops of the 1700s, and providing a model.  Because of that model, and customs that stretch back to the first apothecary shops in the medieval Arab world&lt;ref name=kelly1&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|2006|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; most drugstores continued selling more general goods, perfumes, cosmetics, and drinks of all sorts alongside medicines, and still do.

====Non-British influences====
That the Spanish colonials, not the British, were the first in North America to license a pharmacist (in 1769 in New Orleans)&lt;ref name=&quot;Kremers149&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kremers and Sonnedecker|1986|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were also the first to regulate pharmacy as a separate profession, points to the importance of non-British colonial governments and, indeed, settlers from mainland Europe throughout North America, in importing and translating the more modern pharmacy methods, standards and ways of organization and regulation—developing in Europe since at least the 1600s—for application in the infant United States.

[[Spanish Louisiana|&quot;Franco-Spanish&quot; Louisiana]] &quot;more clearly reflected [pharmacy's] development in [[Continental Europe]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Cowen110&gt;{{harvnb|Cowen|1990|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Influential milestones achieved in 18th century Louisiana included the February 12th, 1770 edict from the [[Spanish Governor of Louisiana#Spanish period|governor in New Orleans]], [[Alejandro O'Reilly|Don Alexandre O'Reilly]], delineating the responsibilities and boundaries of medicine, surgery and pharmacy and marking the first legal recognition of pharmacy as a distinct discipline in the territories that would become the United States.&lt;ref name=Cowen110/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kremers149&quot;/&gt;  Though the number of pharmacists licensed under this system in Spanish Louisiana never surpassed the single-digits, O'Reilly's decree and its ethical code for pharmacists set an important precedent future developments would build upon.  It also brought on-line an important independent pipeline of licensed druggists, albeit a small pipeline, to add to the scant supply of Old World apothecaries who had immigrated to set up shop in the colonies.

Of the few apothecaries imported from Europe, those of [[Jesuit]] training had a long-felt impact in both [[New Spain]] and [[New France]]; so great was Jesuit involvement in &quot;care of the sick&quot; in their foreign missions, in fact, they sought and received a papal exemption from the ban on clerics serving in medical roles.&lt;ref name=Ignatius&gt;{{cite journal|last=Welie|first=Jos V. M.|title=Ignatius of Loyola on Medical Education. Or: Should Today's Jesuits Continue to Run Health Sciences Schools?|journal=Early Science and Medicine|date=2003|volume=8|issue=1|pages=38–39|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4130497|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two dedicated &quot;pharmacopoles or apothecary brethren&quot; Jesuits are listed under the heading &quot;Missions of North America in New France&quot; in [[Society of Jesus]] personnel records for the &quot;Province of France at the End of the Year 1749.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ignatius/&gt;  Jesuit contributions, especially in translating [[Native American ethnobotany]] into medicines for European use, were highly influential as pharmacy developed in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kremers151&quot;/&gt;

====In British North America====
Pharmacist Ambrose Hunsberger, in his sweeping introduction covering pharmacy's development in the United States prior to the events discussed in his 1923 article on [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]'s impact, &quot;The Practice of Pharmacy Under the [[Volstead Act]],&quot; described pharmacy before its organization (which he places around 1821) in terms that evoke the [[snake oil]] salesmen and [[medicine show]]s that hit every town, hamlet and village in the country: &quot;...the disorganized system of hawking medicinal remedies which prevailed throughout our thinly populated country. There was no method of protecting the public from fraud through control or regulation of the sale of adulterated and harmful medicinal products, and the credulous citizenry of the young nation was beguiled by every description of fakir and charlatan into buying their fantastic panaceas.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hunsberger1&gt;{{harvnb|Hunsberger|1923|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hunsberger puts the practice of &quot;more or less methodical&quot; pharmacy in Europe &quot;two or three centuries&quot; back, as early as the 16th or 17th centuries, whereas he places the start of organized pharmacy in the United States with the founding of America's first formal college of pharmacy, the [[Philadelphia College of Pharmacy]] (PCP), in 1821.&lt;ref name=Hunsberger1/&gt;

Prior to this, however, the [[thirteen colonies|original British colonies]] retained a much more ad-hoc, improvisational approach to pharmacy, and &quot;there were, as was to be expected in a land so vast and so sparsely settled, virtually no limitations as to where or by whom pharmacy could be practiced.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cowen110/&gt;  Lines between the professions of pharmacist, wholesale druggist and physician did not yet exist in the way they would later; &quot;their provinces overlapped, and appellations, which often meant little, frequently changed.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cowen110/&gt;  [[Image:Three early medicine bottles.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An empty bottle of True Daffy's Elixir (center) Dicey and Co.|Dicey and Co.'s '''[[Daffy's Elixir|True Daffy's Elixir]]''', its 18th century-type embossed medicine bottle seen here (center), was one of the more popular examples of the patent medicines Americans imported from across the Atlantic in the 18th and 19th centuries.]]In the colonial and early independence years, necessity demanded a do-it-yourself approach to pharmacy.  &quot;Most, if not all, American medical men prepared and dispensed their own medications, since fee bills and custom usually provided fees for the medication and not the visit, unless surgery or delivery was involved.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;renateWilson1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Renate|last2=Savacool|first2=Woodrow|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/27774311|title=The theory and practice of pharmacy in Pennsylvania: Observations on two colonial country doctors|journal=Pennsylvania History|year=2001|volume=68|issue=1|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, oftentimes the doctor was the apothecary and the apothecary the doctor, especially among rural &quot;country doctors&quot; who predominated in this era of farmers with &quot;freeholds&quot; thinly dotting the colonies.  &quot;Even in the 1760s, when a younger and largely native born cohort of physicians returned from Europe, most of the reputable and even famous among the American medici ran their own pharmaceutical business,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;renateWilson1&quot;/&gt; which, for most doctors for the bulk of the 18th century included mostly medications mixed and dispensed by hand, sometimes augmented with a supply of [[patent medicines]] imported from the UK or mainland Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson and Savacool|2001|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cities, the foundations of commercial pharmacy were slowly building.  By 1721 there were &quot;14 apothecary shops in Boston,&quot;&lt;ref name=kelly2/&gt; and the first &quot;commissioned pharmaceutical officer in an American army&quot; was the Boston apothecary, [[Andrew Craigie]].&lt;ref name=WSU22&gt;{{harvnb|WSU History of Pharmacy|Scene 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A sort of warrior-apothecary, he took part in the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], June 17, 1775. And &quot;when Congress reorganized the Medical Department of the Army in 1777, Craigie became the first Apothecary General.&quot;&lt;ref name=WSU22/&gt;

Important early American &quot;apothecary shops&quot; include the one in colonial [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] run by later-brigadier general in the [[Continental Army]], [[Hugh Mercer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kremers and Sonnedecker|1986|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the building is now a museum, and has been &quot;scientifically dated&quot; to 1771 or 1772&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Buildings in the Fredericksburg Area|url=http://www.simplyfredericksburg.com/visit/buildings3.shtml|publisher=Simply Fredericksburg|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  And the Marshall Apothecary (established 1729, open for 96 years)&lt;ref name=WSU19&gt;{{harvnb|WSU History of Pharmacy|Scene 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Philadelphia, which was a manufacturer of medicines as well as a retailer, and served as an important supplier throughout the [[Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name=kelly2/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSU19/&gt;  Advertisements from the period indicate &quot;that there were drugstores in virtually all American cities by the end of the eighteenth century.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cowen110/&gt;

Economic historian [[Bernice Hamilton]] describes the 1700s as having &quot;completely transformed&quot; all &quot;the medical professions,&quot; explaining that &quot;advances in medical education and science,&quot; the emergence of a robust middle class, &quot;as well as the growth of 'a professional feeling'&quot; had greatly changed the socio-economic order by the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;BerniceHamilton1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2599120 | title=The Medical Professions in the Eighteenth Century | author=Hamilton, Bernice | journal=The Economic History Review, New Series | year=1951 | publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]], [[Economic History Society]] | volume=4 | issue=2 | pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thanks to the ruling in the [[Rose Case]] back in London, apothecaries began 1705 as fully accredited medical professionals who could write prescriptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Pharmaceutical&quot;/&gt;  Hamilton notes &quot;…the apothecaries, once mere tradesmen and the 'servants of the physician,' had become practicing doctors,&quot; treating patients directly.&lt;ref name=&quot;BerniceHamilton1&quot;/&gt;  These trends spread to the colonies, and though apothecaries never organized into a legally distinct and guilded profession in North America, the rural hinterlands mirrored the prevalence of the apothecary in Britain, where &quot;in more remote locales, the apothecary 'was usually the only doctor.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton|1951|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pharmacopoeia, which simply lists useful drugs—or sometimes more importantly, drops questionable substances from the canon—&quot;came fully into its own in the [[Early modern period|early modern age]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cowen|1990|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing roughly the span of history covering the 1500s up until the [[French Revolution]]s in the late 1700s.  But pharmacopoeias mainly offered some basics and compounding instructions.[[File:Lewis William lab.jpg|left|thumb|An engraving depicting an 18th-century chemical laboratory, from [[William Lewis (scientist)|William Lewis]]' later work ''Commercium Philosophico-Technicum'' (mid-1760s)|160 px]]  Not until the first ''dispensatories'' were there books disseminating more comprehensive information on pharmaceuticals: guidance on uses for drugs, how and in what situations to employ them, experience with best practices, etc.  &quot;This kind of book, the dispensatory, became something of a British specialty in the late seventeenth and eighteenth century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CowenReNewDispensatory&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowen|1990|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These dispensatories, chief among them [[William Lewis (scientist)|William Lewis]]' ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kBQ7AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Lewis++Dispensatory&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1 The New Dispensatory]'', which debuted in 1753 and was regarded as &quot;the first truly scientific work on pharmacy in the [[English language]],&quot;&lt;ref name=Cowen101&gt;{{harvnb|Cowen|1990|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a later (1786) book intended as &quot;'an improvement' on Lewis,&quot; the ''Edinburgh New Dispensatory'',&lt;ref name=Cowen101/&gt; were undoubtedly formative for pharmacy in British North America.  The ''New Dispensatory'' and ''Edinburgh New Dispensatory'' were printed in many editions and numerous languages within their lifespans (1753-1830) including six printings for American use between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowen102&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowen|1990|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;'

==The nineteenth century: American pharmacy emerges==
The 19th century (1800s) birthed &quot;pharmacy as we know it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cowen110/&gt;  And again, pharmacy's development in mainland Europe continued to fuel its growth in the young American republic.

===The Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and the birth of organized American pharmacy===
The [[Philadelphia College of Pharmacy]] (PCP), modeled—at least in concept—after the ''Collége de pharmacie'' in Paris,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kremers192&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kremers and Sonnedecker|1986|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; was aided by European talent in its early, formative years.  [[Elias Durand]], who had served as &quot;''pharmacien'' of the [[Grand Army]] of [[Napoleon I]],&quot; set up shop in Philadelphia in 1825, and &quot;...in connection with the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, immediately exerted a strong foreign influence on American pharmacy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kremers192&quot;/&gt; According to [[#The &quot;Father of American Pharmacy&quot;|William Procter, Jr.]], Durand &quot;directly and indirectly had much to do with the introduction of scientific pharmacy into Philadelphia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kremers192&quot;/&gt;  Without teaching at the college, Durand still had a big impact by spreading new findings about medicinal plants, making &quot;medicinal chemicals&quot; never before created in the U.S., by training apprentices, like [[Augustine Duhamel]], who went on to make important contributions and publish in the college journal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kremers192&quot;/&gt; and by serving as a role model for foundational figures like Procter.&lt;ref name=ANbiography/&gt;

Hunsberger cites the founding of the [[Philadelphia College of Pharmacy]] (PCP) as &quot;the first step forward in the development of a system of pharmaceutical practice in the United States,&quot;&lt;ref name=Hunsberger1/&gt; with the 1821 &quot;meeting of apothecaries...held in [[Carpenters' Hall]]&quot; (where the [[Declaration of Independence]] had been signed) to set up the first formal college of pharmacy and first pharmacists' association (the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy) in North America&lt;ref name=kellypg6&gt;{{harvnb|Kelly|2006|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the seminal founding event.&lt;ref name=Hunsberger1/&gt;  On March 13, 1821, &quot;Sixty-eight pharmacists signed the Constitution of the first pharmaceutical association in the United States,&quot;&lt;ref name=WSU25&gt;{{harvnb|WSU History of Pharmacy|Scene 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the symbolism of the [[Carpenters' Hall]] backdrop undeniable: American pharmacy would have a constitution, following in the footsteps of the [[founding fathers]] and their constitutional framework.  The PCP constitution included a strict code of ethics that would expel anyone from the college who &quot;adulterated&quot; medications or knowingly sold &quot;articles of that character,&quot; and provided for a &quot;committee of inspection&quot; to verify the purity, safety and effectiveness of medicines, and a &quot;committee of equity&quot; to arbitrate disputes between member pharmacists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kremers192&quot;/&gt;
The college, which was founded as an association to advance the discipline of pharmacy not just a university, quickly became a game-changer: in 1824 they published &quot;carefully determined formulas&quot; for the fabrication of (formerly) &quot;secret-formula&quot; [[patent medicines]] previously imported from [[the UK]], an essential step toward self-sufficient pharmaceutical manufacturing in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kremers192&quot;/&gt;

The Philadelphia College of Pharmacy also aided the rise of the [[American Pharmaceutical Association]] (APhA), which formed at a founding convention congregated in the Hall of the College, October 6 to 8, 1852.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSU27&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|WSU History of Pharmacy|Scene 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Daniel B. Smith]], who had long been the PCP's president—ultimately from 1829 to 1854—was elected the [[APhA]]'s first president at the founding convention, and William Procter, Jr. the first secretary.&lt;ref name=WSU27/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WD222&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Western Druggist|1899|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The &quot;Father of American Pharmacy&quot;====
[[William Procter, Jr.]], who graduated from, then taught at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy for 20 years, went on to exert so much influence over the formative years of professional pharmacy that he's now widely considered the &quot;''Father of American Pharmacy''.&quot;&lt;ref name=ANbiography/&gt;&lt;ref name=kellypg6/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSU29&gt;{{harvnb|WSU History of Pharmacy|Scene 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Procter successfully argued for the establishment of a chair of Pharmacy for pharmacist-professors at the PCP in 1844,&lt;ref name=ANbiography&gt;{{cite web|last=Higby|first=Gregory J.|title=Procter, William, Jr.|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/12/12-00745.html|work=American National Biography Online|publisher=Oxford Index|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; then wrote &quot;the first American pharmacy textbook,&quot; which came to be known as Mohr, Redwood, and Procter's ''Practical Pharmacy'' (1849).  The book was not commercially successful, but became a model for subsequent &quot;works of long-lived popularity: [[Edward Parrish]]'s ''An Introduction to Practical Pharmacy'' (1855-1884), and [[Joseph P. Remington]]'s ''Practice of Pharmacy'' (1888-1995 [19th ed.])&quot;.&lt;ref name=ANbiography/&gt;  Procter also led the [[American Journal of Pharmacy]] for 22 years, served 30 years on the U.S.P. Revision Committee, where he did much to improve the [[U.S. Pharmacopeia]],&lt;ref name=WSU29/&gt; and following five years as the [[American Pharmaceutical Association]]'s corresponding secretary,&lt;ref name=ANbiography/&gt; he became the APhA's president, leading delegations of American pharmacists in conferences with their counterparts offshore.  At the Second International Congress of Pharmacy in Paris, France, August 21 to 24, 1867, Procter argued forcefully against the &quot;compulsory limitation of pharmacies&quot; (capping their number in a given city or province) under consideration, telling the assembled delegates that, in the U.S., &quot;there is not the slightest obstacle toward a multiplication of drug stores save that a lack of success&quot; and that the American public is &quot;a forceful agent of reform&quot;&lt;ref name=WSU28&gt;{{harvnb|WSU History of Pharmacy|Scene 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to keep unscrupulous operators in check.  Procter's declaration was later seen as a defining statement of &quot;the American Way of Pharmacy.&quot;&lt;ref name=WSU28/&gt;

====Pharmacy schools and professional organizations spread====
Other major cities on the [[Eastern Seaboard]] followed Philadelphia's lead, establishing university training programs, professional associations and colleges of pharmacy that acted as professional associations like the PCP.  [[New York City]] was among the quickest to follow suit with the [[New York College of Pharmacy]], established 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New York Observer Year Book|date=1873|publisher=Sidney E. Morse, Jr. &amp; Company|page=171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-0TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [http://www.webcitation.org/6NawKFexi this 1851 notice] from the ''New York Daily Times'' exemplifies, pharmacy schools (here the New York College of Pharmacy) often ''were'' acting as professional associations, or at least promoted pharmacist education and the distinct profession of pharmacist with a guild-like zeal, with this article advertising training for &quot;those who desire to qualify themselves thoroughly as Apothecaries&quot; while calling out &quot;inferior druggists&quot; and cautioning that &quot;community ought not to be indifferent&quot; to the character and motives of druggists who &quot;stand aloof from the College.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY1851&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hn.bigchalk.com/pqdocs/share4/pqimage/hnirs102v/201402230106/43184/8472/out.pdf |title=College of Pharmacy |date=5 November 1851 |accessdate=23 February 2014 |newspaper=New York Daily Times |location=New York, NY |pages=2 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6NawKFexi |archivedate=February 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Note the use of the term &quot;druggists&quot; to denote medication providers who are not trained pharmacists, while the term &quot;apothecary&quot; is still used as positive synonym.

===Pharmacy and the Industrial Revolution===
With the rise of mechanization and mass production, new modes of medication-delivery, among them the tablet (1884),&lt;ref name=Cowen165&gt;{{harvnb|Cowen|1990|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; the enteric-coated pill (1884)&lt;ref name=Cowen166&gt;{{harvnb|Cowen|1990|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the gelatin capsule (first produced on a large scale in 1875 by [[Parke, Davis &amp; Company]], Detroit)&lt;ref name=Cowen165/&gt; became practicable.  By 1900, most pharmacies stocked the shelves, partially or predominantly, with medicines prefabricated en masse by the growing pharmaceutical industry instead of custom-produced by individual pharmacisti, and the traditional role of the scientifically trained pharmacist to produce medicines increasingly eroded. This shift worried many, raising concerns of quality control, professional irrelevance and more. William Procter lamented that, &quot;If the pharmacist becomes a mere dispenser of medicines, 'he relapses into a simple shopkeeper.'”&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Swann|2009|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four passenger [[airliner]]s operated by two major U.S. passenger [[Airline|air carriers]] ([[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]])—all of which departed from airports on the [[northeastern United States]] bound for [[California]]—were [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|19 al-Qaeda terrorists]]. Two of the planes, [[American Airlines Flight 11]] and [[United Airlines Flight 175]], were crashed into the [[One World Trade Center#Original building (1970–2001)|North]] and [[Two World Trade Center#Original building (1971–2001)|South towers]], respectively, of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] complex in [[New York City]]. Within an hour and 42 minutes, both 110-story [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|towers collapsed]], with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex, including the 47-story [[7 World Trade Center]] tower, as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures. A third plane, [[American Airlines Flight 77]], was crashed into [[the Pentagon]] (the headquarters of the [[United States Department of Defense]]) in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], leading to a partial collapse of the building's western side. The fourth plane, [[United Airlines Flight 93]], initially was steered toward [[Washington, D.C.]], but crashed into a field in [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Stonycreek Township]] near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]], after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers. It was the [[List of the deadliest firefighter disasters in the United States|deadliest incident for firefighters]] and [[List of American police officers killed in the line of duty|law enforcement officers]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Congress&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Congress|title=Congressional Record, Vol. 148, Pt. 7, May 23, 2002 to June 12, 2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCO7Q10SGBUC&amp;pg=PA9909|accessdate=April 9, 2014|publisher=Government Printing Office|page=9909|isbn=978-0-16-076125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[history of the United States]], with 343 and 72 killed respectively.

Suspicion for the attack quickly fell on al-Qaeda. The United States responded to the attacks by launching the [[War on Terror]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invading Afghanistan]] to depose the [[Taliban]], which had harbored al-Qaeda. Many countries strengthened their [[anti-terrorism legislation]] and expanded the powers of [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] and [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] to prevent terrorist attacks. Although al-Qaeda's leader, [[Osama bin Laden]], initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he claimed [[Responsibility for the September 11 attacks|responsibility for the attacks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc-2004&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Bin Laden claims responsibility for 9/11|publisher = CBC News|date=October 29, 2004|url = http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2004/10/29/binladen_message041029.html|accessdate=September 1, 2011 |quote=Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden appeared in a new message aired on an Arabic TV station Friday night, for the first time claiming direct responsibility for the 2001 attacks against the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited [[Israel–United States relations|U.S. support of Israel]], the presence of [[Operation Southern Watch|U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia]], and [[Iraq sanctions|sanctions against Iraq]] as motives. Having evaded capture for almost a decade, [[Death of Osama bin Laden|bin Laden was located and killed]] by [[SEAL Team Six]] of the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] in May 2011.

The destruction of the World Trade Center and nearby infrastructure caused serious damage to the economy of [[Lower Manhattan]] and had a significant effect on global markets, closing [[Wall Street]] until September 17 and the civilian airspace in the U.S. and Canada until September 13. Many [[Closings and cancellations following the September 11 attacks|closings, evacuations, and cancellations]] followed, out of respect or fear of further attacks.

==Background==

===Al-Qaeda{{anchor|Al-Qaeda}}===
{{Campaignbox al-Qaeda attacks}}
{{Further|Al-Qaeda|Jihad}}
The origins of al-Qaeda can be traced to 1979 when the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan]]. Osama bin Laden traveled to Afghanistan and helped organize Arab [[mujahideen]] to resist the [[Soviet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Al-Qaeda's origins and links|date=July 20, 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1670089.stm|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the guidance of [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], bin Laden became more radical.&lt;ref name=&quot;gunaratna-p23&quot;&gt;Gunaratna (2002), pp. 23–33.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, bin Laden issued his first ''[[fatwā]]'', calling for American soldiers to leave [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |title=Bin Laden's fatwā (1996) |publisher=PBS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011031024057/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |archivedate=October 31, 2001 |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a second ''fatwā'' in 1998, bin Laden outlined his objections to [[Foreign policy of the United States|American foreign policy]] with respect to [[Israel]], as well as the continued presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia after the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1998FatwaPBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/military-jan-june98-fatwa_1998/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128194258/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/military/jan-june98/fatwa_1998.html|archivedate=November 28, 2013 |title=Al Qaeda's Second Fatwa |work=[[PBS NewsHour]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |deadurl=no |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden used Islamic texts to exhort Muslims to attack Americans until the stated grievances are reversed. [[Ulama|Muslim legal scholars]] &quot;have throughout Islamic history unanimously agreed that the [[jihad]] is an individual duty if the enemy destroys the Muslim countries&quot;, according to bin Laden.&lt;ref name=&quot;1998FatwaPBS&quot; /&gt;

In the video, he said, &quot;It has become clear that the West in general and America in particular have an unspeakable hatred for Islam. ... It is the hatred of [[crusaders]]. Terrorism against America deserves to be praised because it was a response to injustice, aimed at forcing America to stop its support for Israel, which kills our people. ...

Shortly before the [[United States presidential election, 2004|U.S. presidential election in 2004]], in a [[2004 Osama bin Laden video|taped statement]], bin Laden publicly acknowledged al-Qaeda's involvement in the attacks on the U.S. and admitted his direct link to the attacks.

In &quot;Substitution for Testimony of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed&quot; from the trial of [[Zacarias Moussaoui]], five people are identified as having been completely aware of the operation's details. They are bin Laden, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, [[Abu Turab al-Urduni]], and Mohammed Atef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Substitution for Testimony of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed|page=24 |url=http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/notablecases/moussaoui/exhibits/defense/941.pdf |year=2006 |publisher=[[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] |accessdate=September 3, 2011 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, only peripheral figures have been tried or convicted for the attacks.

On September 26, 2005, the [[Audiencia Nacional of Spain|Spanish high court]] sentenced [[Abu Dahdah]] to 27 years in prison for conspiracy on the 9/11 attacks and being a member of the terrorist organization al-Qaeda. At the same time, another 17 al-Qaeda members were sentenced to penalties of between six and eleven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/spain-jails-18-alqaeda-operatives/2005/09/27/1127586828047.html |title=Spain jails 18 al-Qaeda operatives|work=The Age |location=Melbourne |date=September 27, 2005 |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 2006, the Spanish Supreme Court reduced the Abu Dahdah penalty to 12 years because it considered that his participation in the conspiracy was not proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Philippe |last=Naughton |title=Spanish court quashes 9/11 conviction |date=June 1, 2006 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article670596.ece |work=The Times |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in 2006, Moussaoui, who some originally suspected might have been the assigned 20th hijacker, was convicted for the lesser role of conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism and air piracy.

===Motives===

After the attacks, bin Laden and [[al-Zawahiri]] released additional [[Videos of Osama bin Laden|video tapes]] and audio tapes, some of which repeated those reasons for the attacks. Two particularly important publications were bin Laden's 2002 &quot;Letter to America&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;BLLTA&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver |title=Full transcript of bin Laden's &quot;Letter to America&quot; |work=The Guardian |date=November 24, 2002|accessdate=September 3, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2004 video tape by bin Laden.&lt;ref name='Full Ladin'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2004/11/200849163336457223.html| title = Full transcript of bin Ladin's speech |accessdate=April 10, 2012 |last=bin Laden |first=Osama | publisher = [[Al Jazeera]] | quote=&quot;So I shall talk to you about the story behind those events and shall tell you truthfully about the moments in which the decision was taken, for you to consider&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden interpreted [[Muhammad]] as having banned the &quot;permanent presence of infidels in Arabia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;holywar-p3&quot;&gt;Bergen (2001), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[Fatawā of Osama bin Laden|bin Laden issued]] a ''[[fatwā]]'' calling for American troops to leave Saudi Arabia. In 1998, al-Qaeda wrote, &quot;for over seven years the United States has been occupying the lands of Islam in the holiest of places, the Arabian Peninsula, plundering its riches, dictating to its rulers, humiliating its people, terrorizing its neighbors, and turning its bases in the Peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the neighboring Muslim peoples.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1998 Al Qaeda fatwā&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm |title=1998 Al Qaeda fatwā |publisher=Fas.org |date=February 23, 1998|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a December 1999 interview, bin Laden said he felt that Americans were &quot;too near to [[Mecca]]&quot;, and considered this a provocation to the entire Muslim world.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-20010926&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/sep/26/afghanistan.terrorism3 |title=Face to face with Osama |work=The Guardian |date=September 26, 2001|location=London|accessdate=September 3, 2011 |first=Rahimullah | last=Yusufzai}}&lt;/ref&gt; One analysis of suicide terrorism suggested that without U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, al-Qaeda likely would not have been able to get people to commit to suicide missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pape |first= Robert A. |authorlink= Robert Pape |title= [[Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism]] |year= 2005 |publisher= Random House |location= New York |isbn= 0-8129-7338-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1998 ''fatwā'', al-Qaeda identified the Iraq sanctions as a reason to kill Americans, condemning the &quot;protracted blockade&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1998 Al Qaeda fatwā&quot; /&gt; among other actions that constitute a declaration of war against &quot;Allah, his messenger, and Muslims.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1998 Al Qaeda fatwā&quot; /&gt; The ''fatwā'' declared that &quot;the ruling to kill the Americans and their allies&amp;nbsp;– civilians and military&amp;nbsp;– is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] and the holy mosque of [[Mecca]] from their grip, and in order for their [the Americans'] armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1998FatwaPBS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the 1998 [[Fatawā of Osama bin Laden|Al-Qaeda ''fatwā'']]: &quot;The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies&amp;nbsp;– civilians and military&amp;nbsp;– is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque [Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim.&quot; Quoted from {{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/military-jan-june98-fatwa_1998/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128194258/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/military/jan-june98/fatwa_1998.html|archivedate=November 28, 2013 |title=Al Qaeda's Second Fatwa |work=[[PBS NewsHour]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |deadurl=no |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden claimed, in 2004, that the idea of destroying the towers had first occurred to him in 1982, when he witnessed Israel's bombardment of high-rise apartment buildings during the [[1982 Lebanon War]].&lt;ref&gt;Summers and Swan (2011), pp. 211, 506n.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (2005), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts, including Mearsheimer and Walt, also claim that one motivation for the attacks was U.S. support of Israel.&lt;ref name=isrsources /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-20010926&quot; /&gt; In 2004 and 2010, bin Laden again connected the September 11 attacks with U.S. support of Israel, although most of the letter expressed bin Laden's disdain for President Bush and bin Laden's hope to &quot;destroy and bankrupt&quot; the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Full transcript of bin Ladin's speech|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2004/11/200849163336457223.html%20online%20here|work=Al Jazeera|accessdate=24 August 2016|date=November 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his taped broadcast from January 2010, Bin Laden said &quot;Our attacks against you [the United States] will continue as long as U.S. support for Israel continues. … The message sent to you with the attempt by the hero Nigerian [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] is a confirmation of our previous message conveyed by the heroes of September 11&quot;.

Other motives have been suggested in addition to those stated by bin Laden and al-Qaeda, including western support of Islamic and non-Islamic authoritarian regimes in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan and northern Africa, and the presence of western troops in some of these countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JC2NzdH0K1cC&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=dictatorship%209%2F11%20saudi%20arabia&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=dictatorship%209%2F11%20saudi%20arabia&amp;f=false |title=Before and After 9/11: A Philosophical Examination of Globalization, Terror |date= April 21, 2011|accessdate=September 11, 2011|isbn=978-1-4411-1892-9|author1=Rockmore|first1=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors suggest the &quot;humiliation&quot; resulting from the Islamic world falling behind the Western world&amp;nbsp;– this discrepancy rendered especially visible by the globalization trend&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, 2004. In [[Bernard Lewis]]'s 2004 book ''[[The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror]]'', he argues that animosity toward the West is best understood with the decline of the once powerful [[Ottoman empire]], compounded by the import of western ideas&amp;nbsp;— [[Arab socialism]], [[Liberal movements within Islam|Arab liberalism]] and [[Secularism in the Middle East|Arab secularism]]. During the past three centuries, according to this interpretation, the Islamic world has lost its dominance and its position of leadership in the world, and has fallen behind both the modern West and the rapidly modernizing Orient. The resulting widening gap poses increasingly severe problems, both practical and emotional, for which the rulers, thinkers, and rebels of Islam have not yet found effective answers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In an essay titled &quot;The spirit of terrorism&quot;, [[Jean Baudrillard]] described 9/11 as the first global event that &quot;questions the very process of globalization&quot;. {{cite web |url=http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~ikalmar/illustex/baudriterror.htm |title=The spirit of terrorism |last=Baudrillard |accessdate=June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a desire to provoke the U.S. into a broader war against the Islamic world in the hope of motivating more allies to support al-Qaeda. Similarly, others have argued that 9/11 was a strategic move with the objective of provoking America into a war that would incite a [[pan-Islamism|pan-Islamic]] revolution.&lt;ref&gt;In an essay entitled &quot;Somebody Else's Civil War&quot;, [[Michael Scott Doran]] argues the attacks are best understood as part of a religious conflict within the Muslim world and that Bin Laden's followers &quot;consider themselves an island of true believers surrounded by a sea of iniquity&quot;. Hoping that U.S. retaliation would unite the faithful against the West, bin Laden sought to spark revolutions in Arab nations and elsewhere. Doran argues the [[Osama bin Laden videos]] attempt to provoke a visceral reaction in the Middle East and ensure that Muslim citizens would react as violently as possible to an increase in U.S. involvement in their region. ({{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/57618/michael-scott-doran/somebody-elses-civil-war|title=Somebody Else's Civil War|publisher=Foreign Affairs|accessdate=December 5, 2009}} Reprinted in {{cite book|last1=Hoge|first1=James F.|last2=Rose|first2=Gideon|title=Understanding the War on Terror |publisher=Norton |year=2005 |location=New York|isbn=978-0-87609-347-4|pages=72–75}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Osama bin Laden I Know'', [[Peter Bergen]] argues the attacks were part of a plan to cause the United States to ''increase'' its military and cultural presence in the Middle East, thereby forcing Muslims to confront the idea of a non-Muslim government and to eventually establish conservative Islamic governments in the region.(Bergen (2006), p. 229.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planning of the attacks===

The idea for the attacks came from [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], who first presented it to [[Osama bin Laden]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3128802.stm|title=Suspect 'reveals 9/11 planning'|publisher=BBC News|date=September 22, 2003|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, bin Laden and al-Qaeda were in a period of transition, having just relocated back to Afghanistan from [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch5&quot;&gt;9/11 Commission Report, Chapter 5, pp ??&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 African Embassy bombings]] and bin Laden's 1998 fatwā marked a turning point, as bin Laden became intent on attacking the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch5&quot; /&gt;

In late 1998 or early 1999, bin Laden gave approval for Mohammed to go forward with organizing the plot. A series of meetings occurred in early 1999, involving Mohammed, bin Laden, and his deputy [[Mohammed Atef]].&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch5&quot; /&gt; Atef provided operational support for the plot, including target selections and helping arrange travel for the hijackers.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch5&quot; /&gt; Bin Laden overruled Mohammed, rejecting some potential targets such as the [[U.S. Bank Tower (Los Angeles)|U.S. Bank Tower]] in Los Angeles because, &quot;there was not enough time to prepare for such an operation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E7DF1031F933A15750C0A9659C8B63|title=Bin Laden Chose 9/11 Targets, Al Qaeda Leader Says|work=New York Times|last=Lichtblau|first=Eric|date=March 20, 2003|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright (2006), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden provided leadership and financial support for the plot, and was involved in selecting participants.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen (2006), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden initially selected [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]] and [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]], both experienced jihadists who had fought in [[Bosnian war|Bosnia]]. Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived in the United States in mid-January 2000. In spring 2000, Hazmi and Mihdhar took flying lessons in [[San Diego, California]], but both spoke little English, performed poorly with flying lessons, and eventually served as secondary&amp;nbsp;– or &quot;muscle&quot;&amp;nbsp;– hijackers.&lt;ref&gt;Wright (2006), pp. 309–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDermott (2005), pp. 191–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1999, a group of men from [[Hamburg, Germany]] arrived in Afghanistan, including Mohamed Atta, [[Marwan al-Shehhi]], [[Ziad Jarrah]], and Ramzi bin al-Shibh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Bernstein|title=On Path to the U.S. Skies, Plot Leader Met bin Laden|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/10/national/10PLOT.html?ex=1221624000&amp;en=30bc6f683535b59f&amp;ei=5070|work=New York Times|date=September 10, 2002|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden selected these men because they were educated, could speak English, and had experience living in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Wright (2006), pp. 304–07.&lt;/ref&gt; New recruits were routinely screened for special skills and al-Qaeda leaders consequently discovered that [[Hani Hanjour]] already had a commercial pilot's license.&lt;ref&gt;Wright (2006), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammed later said that he helped the hijackers blend in by teaching them how to order food in restaurants and dress in Western clothing.{{sfn|Jessee|2006|p=371}}

===Intelligence before the attacks===
In late 1999, al-Qaeda associate [[Khallad]] contacted Mihdhar, telling him to meet him in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]; Hazmi and [[Abu Bara al Yemeni]] would also be in attendance. The [[NSA]] intercepted a telephone call mentioning the meeting, Mihdhar, and the name &quot;Nawaf&quot; (Hazmi). While the agency feared that &quot;Something nefarious might be afoot&quot;, it took no further action. The CIA had already been alerted by Saudi intelligence to the status of Mihdhar and Hazmi as al-Qaeda members, and a CIA team broke into Mihdhar's [[Dubai]] hotel room and discovered that Mihdhar had a U.S. visa. While [[Alec Station]] alerted intelligence agencies worldwide about this fact, it did not share this information with the FBI. The [[Malaysian Special Branch]] observed the January 5, 2000, meeting of the two al-Qaeda members, and informed the CIA that Mihdhar, Hazmi, and Khallad were flying to [[Bangkok]], but the CIA never notified other agencies of this, nor did it ask the [[State Department]] to put Mihdhar on its watchlist. An FBI liaison to Alec Station asked permission to inform the FBI of the meeting, but was told that &quot;'This is not a matter for the FBI.'&quot;{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=310-312}}

By late June, senior counter-terrorism official [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] and CIA director [[George Tenet]] were &quot;convinced that a major series of attacks was about to come&quot;, although the CIA believed that the attacks would likely occur in Saudi Arabia or Israel.{{sfn|Clarke|2004|pp=235-236}} In early July, Clarke put domestic agencies on &quot;full alert&quot;, telling them that &quot;Something really spectacular is going to happen here... soon.&quot; He asked the FBI and the State Department to alert the embassies and police departments, and the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] to go to &quot;Threat Condition Delta.&quot;{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=344}}{{sfn|Clarke|2004|pp=236-237}} Clarke would later write that &quot;Somewhere in CIA there was information that two known al Qaeda terrorists had come into the United States... in [the] FBI there was information that strange things had been going on at flight schools in the United States... They had specific information about individual terrorists... None of that information got to me or the White House.&quot;{{sfn|Clarke|2004|pp=242-243}}

On July 13, Tom Wilshire, a CIA agent assigned to the FBI's international terrorism division, emailed his superiors at the CIA's [[Counterterrorism Center]] (CTC), requesting permission to inform the FBI that Hazmi was in the country and that Mihdhar had a U.S. visa. However, the CIA never responded.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=340}}

The same day in July, Margarette Gillespie, an FBI analyst working in the CTC, was told to review material about the Malaysia meeting. She was not told of the participants' presence in the U.S. However, the CIA did give Gillespie surveillance photos of Mihdhar and Hazmi from the meeting to show to FBI counterterrorism, but did not tell her their significance. The Intelink database informed her not to share intelligence material on the meeting to criminal investigators. When shown the photos, the FBI were refused more details on their significance, and also did not receive Mihdhar's date of birth or passport number.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=340-343}} In late August 2001, Gillespie told the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]], the State Department, the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]], and the FBI to put Hazmi and Mihdhar on their watchlists, but the FBI was prohibited from using criminal agents in the search for the duo, which hindered their efforts.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=352-353}}

Also in July, a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]-based FBI agent sent a message to FBI headquarters, Alec Station, and to FBI agents in New York, alerting them to &quot;the possibility of a coordinated effort by Osama bin Laden to send students to the United States to attend civil aviation universities and colleges.&quot; The agent, Kenneth Williams, suggested the need to interview all flight school managers and identify all Arab students seeking flight training.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=350}} In July, Jordan alerted the U.S. that al-Qaeda was planning an attack on the U.S.; &quot;months later&quot;, Jordan notified the U.S. that the attack's codename was &quot;The Big Wedding&quot;, and that it involved airplanes.{{sfn|Yitzhak|2016|p=218}}

On August 6, the CIA's Presidential Daily Brief, designated &quot;For the President Only&quot;, was entitled &quot;Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S.&quot; The memo noted that &quot;The FBI information... indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE OSAMA BIN LADEN FILE: National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 343|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB343/|website=The National Security Archive|publisher=The National Security Archive|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-August, one [[Minnesota]] flight school alerted the FBI to [[Zacarias Moussaoui]], who had asked &quot;suspicious questions.&quot; The FBI found that he was a radical who had traveled to Pakistan, and the INS arrested him for overstaying his [[France|French]] visa. However, their request to search his laptop was denied by FBI headquarters due to the lack of [[probable cause]].{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=350-351}}

The failures in intelligence-sharing were attributed to 1995 [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] policies limiting intelligence sharing, combined with CIA and NSA reluctance in revealing &quot;sensitive sources and methods&quot; such as tapped phones.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=342-343}} Testifying before the [[9/11 Commission]] in April 2004, then-[[Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] recalled that the &quot;single greatest structural cause for the September 11th problem was the wall that segregated or separated criminal investigators and intelligence agents.&quot;{{sfn|Javorsek|Rose|Marshall|Leitner|2015|p=742}} Clarke also wrote that &quot;There were failures in the organizations... failures to get information to the right place at the right time...&quot;{{sfn|Clarke|2004|p=238}}

{{Further|Timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks}}

[[File:Flight paths of hijacked planes-September 11 attacks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Flight paths of the four planes used on September 11]]

Early on the morning of September 11, 2001, [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|19 hijackers]] took control of four commercial airliners (two [[Boeing 757]] and two [[Boeing 767]]) en route to California (three headed to [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] in [[Los Angeles]], and one to [[San Francisco International Airport|SFO]] in [[San Francisco]]) after takeoffs from [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]; [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]; and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]] and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]] counties in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch1&quot; /&gt; Large planes with long flights were selected for hijacking because they would be heavily fueled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chap7&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--weren't early morning flights also chosen because they would have fewer passengers to overcome?--&gt;

The four flights were:
* [[American Airlines Flight 11]]: a Boeing 767 aircraft, departed Logan Airport at 7:59&amp;nbsp;a.m. en route to Los Angeles with a crew of 11 and 76 passengers, not including five hijackers. The hijackers flew the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in [[New York City]] at 8:46&amp;nbsp;a.m.
* [[United Airlines Flight 175]]: a Boeing 767 aircraft, departed Logan Airport at 8:14&amp;nbsp;a.m. en route to Los Angeles with a crew of nine and 51 passengers, not including five hijackers. The hijackers flew the plane into the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City at 9:03&amp;nbsp;a.m.
* [[American Airlines Flight 77]]: a Boeing 757 aircraft, departed Washington Dulles International Airport at 8:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. en route to Los Angeles with a crew of six and 53 passengers, not including five hijackers. The hijackers flew the plane into the Pentagon in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], at 9:37&amp;nbsp;a.m.
* [[United Airlines Flight 93]]: a Boeing 757 aircraft, departed Newark International Airport at 8:42&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;!--wasn't it late taking off, which allowed the passengers to hear of the others?--&gt; en route to San Francisco, with a crew of seven and 33 passengers, not including four hijackers. As passengers attempted to subdue the hijackers, the aircraft crashed into a field in [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Stonycreek Township]] near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]], at 10:03&amp;nbsp;a.m.

Media coverage was extensive during the attacks and aftermath, beginning moments after the first crash into the World Trade Center.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, news coverage by CNN: {{cite journal|journal=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/us/2011/09/07/natpkg-911-aircheck-timeline.cnn.html|title=Breaking News Videos from CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- this is not a journal, this needs to be fixed. --&gt;

The aftermath of the 9/11 attack resulted in immediate responses to the event, including domestic reactions, hate crimes, Muslim responses to the event, international responses to the attack, and military responses to the events. An extensive compensation program was quickly established by Congress in the aftermath to compensate the victims and families of victims of the 9/11 attack as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Gets What: Fair Compensation after Tragedy and Financial Upheaval | first = Kenneth | last = Feinberg |date=June 2012 | publisher = [[PublicAffairs]] | location = New York City | isbn = 9781586489779 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Kenneth.

[[File:Dust covered 911 victims.jpg|thumb|Survivors were covered in dust after the collapse of the towers.]]

Hundreds of thousands of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants, including known carcinogens, were spread across Lower Manhattan due to the collapse of the Twin Towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Anita |last=Gates |title=Buildings Rise from Rubble while Health Crumbles |work=The New York Times |date=September 11, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/11/arts/television/11dust.html?ref=nyregionspecial3 |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2006/09/05/nyregion/20060905_HEALTH_GRAPHIC.html |title=What was Found in the Dust |work=New York Times |date=September 5, 2006|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to [[Health effects arising from the September 11 attacks|fatal or debilitating illnesses]] among people who were at ground zero.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|title= New York: 9/11 toxins caused death|publisher=CNN| date=May 24, 2007|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/05/24/wtc.dust/index.html|accessdate=September 4, 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070618154824/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/05/24/wtc.dust/index.html |archivedate=June 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/13/nyregion/13symptoms.html| title=Tracing Lung Ailments That Rose With 9/11 Dust| last=DePalma| first=Anthony| date=May 13, 2006|work=The New York Times| accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush administration ordered the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality in the aftermath of the attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Heilprin| first = John| title = White House edited EPA's 9/11 reports| publisher = Seattle Post-Intelligencer| date=June 23, 2003| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/White-House-edited-EPA-s-9-11-reports-1122465.php| accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years after the attacks, legal disputes over the costs of illnesses related to the attacks were still in the court system. On October 17, 2006, a federal judge rejected New York City's refusal to pay for health costs for rescue workers, allowing for the possibility of numerous suits against the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Anthony |last=DePalma |title=Many Ground Zero Workers Gain Chance at Lawsuits |work=The New York Times |date=October 18, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/18/nyregion/nyregionspecial3/18toxic.html?ref=nyregion |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower Manhattan in the weeks shortly after the attacks.

The [[United States Congress]] passed the [[James L. Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act]] on December 22, 2010, and President [[Barack Obama]] signed the act into law on January 2, 2011. It allocated $4.2 billion to create the [[World Trade Center Health Program]], which provides testing and treatment for people suffering from long-term health problems related to the 9/11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-22/politics/911.bill_1_first-responders-funding-votes-house-members?_s=PM:POLITICS |work=CNN |title=Bloomberg urges passage of 9/11 health bill |date=December 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327152416/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-22/politics/911.bill_1_first-responders-funding-votes-house-members?_s=PM:POLITICS |archivedate=March 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WTCHP faq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=World Trade Center Health Program FAQ|url=http://www.cdc.gov/wtc/faq.html|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WTC Health Program replaced preexisting 9/11-related health programs such as the Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program and the WTC Environmental Health Center program.&lt;ref name=&quot;WTCHP faq&quot; /&gt;

===Economic===
{{Main article|Economic effects arising from the September 11 attacks}}
[[File:9-11 attacks effect on NYC economy.png|thumb|right|As shown in this table, the 9/11 attacks had a major effect on the economy of New York City (in red), compared to the United States' economy overall (in blue).]]

The attacks had a significant economic impact on United States and world markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Makinen|first=Gail |url=https://fas.org/irp/crs/RL31617.pdf |title=The Economic Effects of 9/11: A Retrospective Assessment |page=17 |date=September 27, 2002 |work=Congressional Research Service |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=September 4, 2011 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stock exchanges did not open on September 11 and remained closed until September 17. Reopening, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (DJIA) fell 684&amp;nbsp;points, or 7.1%, to 8921, a record-setting one-day point decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Markets reopen, plunge| last=Barnhart| first=Bill| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-010917markets,0,5287650.story|work=Chicago Tribune| date=September 17, 2001| accessdate=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the week, the DJIA had fallen 1,369.7&amp;nbsp;points (14.3%), at the time its largest one-week point drop in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkDec&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Fernandez |last=Bob |title=U.S. Markets Decline Again |work=KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News |publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=September 22, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 dollars, U.S. stocks lost $1.4 trillion in valuation for the week.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkDec&quot; /&gt;

In New York City, about 430,000 job-months and $2.8&amp;nbsp;billion dollars in wages were lost in the three months after the attacks. The economic effects were mainly on the economy's export sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dolfman |first1=Michael L. |author2=Wasser, Solidelle F. |journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=127 |year=2004 |title=9/11 and the New York City Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's GDP was estimated to have declined by $27.3&amp;nbsp;billion for the last three months of 2001 and all of 2002. The U.S. government provided $11.2&amp;nbsp;billion in immediate assistance to the [[Government of New York City]] in September 2001, and $10.5&amp;nbsp;billion in early 2002 for economic development and infrastructure needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;crs-5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Makinen|first=Gail |url=https://fas.org/irp/crs/RL31617.pdf |title=The Economic Effects of 9/11: A Retrospective Assessment |page=5 |date=September 27, 2002 |work=Congressional Research Service |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=September 4, 2011 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also hurt were small businesses in [[Lower Manhattan]] near the World Trade Center, 18,000 of which were destroyed or displaced, resulting in lost jobs and their consequent wages. Assistance was provided by [[Small Business Administration]] loans, federal government Community Development Block Grants, and Economic Injury Disaster Loans.&lt;ref name=&quot;crs-5&quot; /&gt; Some {{convert|31900000|sqft|m2}} of Lower Manhattan office space was damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Hensell| first=Lesley| title=Tough Times Loom For Manhattan Commercial Market| url=http://realtytimes.com/rtpages/20011214_downtown.htm| publisher=Realty Times| date=December 14, 2001| accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many wondered whether these jobs would return, and if the damaged tax base would recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Parrott| first = James| title = The Employment Impact of the September 11 World Trade Center Attacks: Updated Estimates based on the Benchmarked Employment Data| publisher = The Fiscal Policy Institute| date=March 8, 2002| url = http://www.fiscalpolicy.org/Employment%20Impact%20of%20September%2011_Update.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of the economic effects of 9/11 show the Manhattan office real-estate market and office employment were less affected than first feared, because of the financial services industry's need for face-to-face interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Fuerst| first = Franz| title = Exogenous Shocks and Real Estate Rental Markets: An Event Study of the 9/11 Attacks and their Impact on the New York Office Market|publisher = Russell Sage Foundation|date=September 7, 2005| ssrn = 800006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Russell |first=James S. |title=Do skyscrapers still make sense?

North American air space was closed for several days after the attacks and air travel decreased upon its reopening, leading to a nearly 20% cutback in air travel capacity, and exacerbating financial problems in the struggling [[Airline|U.S. airline industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bhadra |first1=Dipasis |author2=Texter, Pamela |title=Airline Networks: An Econometric Framework to Analyze Domestic U.S. Air Travel| publisher=[[United States Department of Transportation]]| year=2004| url=http://www.bts.gov/publications/journal_of_transportation_and_statistics/volume_07_number_01/html/paper_06/| accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 11 attacks also led to the U.S. [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|wars in Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/bin-ladens-war-against-the-us-economy/2011/04/27/AFDOPjfF_blog.html |title=Bin Laden's war against the U.S. economy |work=The Washington Post | date=May 3, 2011 | first=Thomas | last=Heath}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as additional [[homeland security]] spending, totaling at least $5 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/osama-bin-laden-didnt-win-but-he-was-enormously-successful/2011/05/02/AFexZjbF_story.html |title=Osama bin Laden didn't win, but he was 'enormously successful' | work=The Washington Post | first=Suzy | last=Khimm | date=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural===
{{Main article|Cultural influence of 9/11}}

The impact of 9/11 extends beyond geopolitics into society and culture in general. Immediate responses to 9/11 included greater focus on home life and time spent with family, higher church attendance, and increased expressions of patriotism such as the flying of flags.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carducci2009b&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernardo J.

Already-running television shows as well as programs developed after 9/11 have reflected [[post-9/11]] cultural concerns.&lt;ref name=popCultureGuid&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Quay | first1 = Sara | last2 = Damico | first2 = Amy | title = September 11 in Popular Culture: A Guide | publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]] | date = September 14, 2010 | isbn = 978-0-313-35505-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- &quot;STOP.

The culture of America succeeding the attacks is noted for heightened security and an increased demand thereof, as well as [[paranoia]] and [[anxiety]] regarding future terrorist attacks that includes most of the nation. Psychologists have also confirmed that there has been an increased amount of national anxiety in commercial air travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200201/anxiety-after-911 |title=Anxiety After 9/11 |author=Brad Schmidt, Ph.d. |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government policies toward terrorism===
As a result of the attacks, many governments across the world passed [[Anti-terrorism legislation|legislation to combat terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Terrorism in the Asia-Pacific: Threat and Response |journal=[[The Journal of Asian Studies]] |year=2004 |first=Andrew |last=Scobell |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=1078–9 |url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=788144 |accessdate=September 4, 2011 |doi=10.1017/S0021911804002463}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, where several of the 9/11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country's liberal asylum policies, two major anti-terrorism packages were enacted. The first removed legal loopholes that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in Germany. The second addressed the effectiveness and communication of intelligence and law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/crs/RL32710.pdf |title=Germany's Role in Fighting Terrorism: Implications for U.S. Policy |accessdate=September 4, 2011 |last1=Miko |first1=Francis |author2=Froehlich, Christian |date=December 27, 2004 |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada passed the [[Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act]], that nation's first anti-terrorism law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-terrorism Act|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/cdnsecurity/|accessdate=November 12, 2013 |newspaper=CBC News|date=February 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom passed the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] and the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Q and A: Anti-terrorism legislation | date = October 17, 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3197394.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Sam | last = Coates | title = After all the fuss dies down, what really happened | date = November 10, 2005 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article588553.ece |work=The Times |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand enacted the [[Terrorism Suppression Act 2002]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrorism Suppression Act 2002|url=http://legislation.co.nz/act/public/2002/0034/19.0/DLM2493700.html|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Department of Homeland Security]] was created by the [[Homeland Security Act]] to coordinate domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The [[USA Patriot Act]] gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned [[sky marshals]] to flights. Further, the [[Aviation and Transportation Security Act]] made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for [[airport security]]. The law created the [[Transportation Security Administration]] to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy.&lt;ref name='Modern World History'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Beck | first1 = Roger | title = Modern World History | chapter = 20 | publisher = [[Holt McDougal]] | year = 2004 | pages = 657–8 | isbn = 978-0-618-69012-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==

===FBI===
[[File:Mohamed Atta.jpg|thumb|alt= A head shot of a man in his thirties looking expressionless toward the camera|[[Mohamed Atta]], an Egyptian national, was the ringleader of the hijackers.]]
Immediately after the attacks, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] started [[PENTTBOM]], the largest criminal inquiry in the history of the United States. At its height, more than half of the FBI's agents worked on the investigation and followed a half-million leads.&lt;ref name='Pentbomb'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/9-11-investigation/9-11-investigation | title = 9/11 Investigation (PENTTBOM) |accessdate=April 11, 2012 | publisher = [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI concluded that there was &quot;clear and irrefutable&quot; evidence linking al-Qaeda and bin Laden to the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimony of Dale L.

The FBI was quickly able to identify the hijackers, including leader Mohamed Atta, when his luggage was discovered at Boston's Logan Airport.

===CIA===
The Inspector General of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) conducted an internal review of the agency's pre-9/11 performance and was harshly critical of senior CIA officials for not doing everything possible to confront terrorism. He criticized their failure to stop two of the 9/11 hijackers, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, as they entered the United States and their failure to share information on the two men with the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/deep-background/|title=Deep Background |publisher=American Conservative| date=April 1, 2005 |accessdate=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, senators from both major U.S. political parties drafted legislation to make the review public.

The ''National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States'' (9/11 Commission), chaired by [[Thomas Kean]] and [[Lee H.

The report detailed the events of 9/11, found the attacks were carried out by members of al-Qaeda, and examined how security and intelligence agencies were inadequately coordinated to prevent the attacks. Formed from an independent bipartisan group of mostly former Senators, Representatives, and Governors, the commissioners explained, &quot;We believe the 9/11 attacks revealed four kinds of failures: in imagination, policy, capabilities, and management&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foresight-and Hindsight|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch11.htm|work=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission made numerous recommendations on how to prevent future attacks, and in 2011 was dismayed that several of its recommendations had yet to be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennett|first=Brian|title=Post-9/11 assessment sees major security gaps|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/30/nation/la-na-911-report-card-20110831|accessdate=September 4, 2011 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) investigated the collapses of the Twin Towers and 7&amp;nbsp;WTC. The investigations examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures were in place, and evaluated how fire protection systems might be improved in future construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;NISTInvest&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=NIST's World Trade Center Investigation |url=http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/nist_investigation_911.cfm|work=National Institute of Standards and Technology |publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce |date=December 14, 2007 |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation into the collapse of 1&amp;nbsp;WTC and 2&amp;nbsp;WTC was concluded in October 2005 and that of 7&amp;nbsp;WTC was completed in August 2008.&lt;ref name=seven&gt;{{cite web|title=NIST WTC 7 Investigation Finds Building Fires Caused Collapse|url=http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/wtc-082108.cfm|publisher=The National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NIST found that the fireproofing on the Twin Towers' steel infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that, had this not occurred, the towers likely would have remained standing.&lt;ref name=&quot;NISTCollapse&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=National Construction Safety Team |url=http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=909017 |title=Final Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center Towers |work=National Institute of Standards and Technology|publisher=United States Department of Commerce |chapter=Executive Summary |date=September 2005| accessdate=April 10, 2011 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study of the north tower's collapse published by researchers of [[Purdue University]] determined that, since the plane's impact had stripped off much of the structure's thermal insulation, the heat from a typical office fire would have softened and weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to initiate the collapse regardless of the number of columns cut or damaged by the impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Even if all of the columns and girders had survived the impact&amp;nbsp;– an unlikely event&amp;nbsp;– the structure would fail as the result of a buckling of the columns. The heat from an ordinary office fire would suffice to soften and weaken the unprotected steel. Evaluation of the effects of the fire on the core column structure, with the insulation removed by the impact, showed that collapse would follow whatever the number of columns cut at the time of the impact.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director of the original investigation stated that, &quot;the towers really did amazingly well. The terrorist aircraft didn't bring the buildings down; it was the fire which followed. It was proven that you could take out two thirds of the columns in a tower and the building would still stand.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TerrorProof&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Building a Terror-Proof Skyscraper: Experts Debate Feasibility, Options |first=Pete |last=Sigmund |url=http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/Building-a-Terror-Proof-Skyscraper-Experts-Debate-Feasibility-Options/2598/ |accessdate=April 11, 2012 |date=September 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fires weakened the trusses supporting the floors, making the floors sag. The sagging floors pulled on the exterior steel columns causing the exterior columns to bow inward. With the damage to the core columns, the buckling exterior columns could no longer support the buildings, causing them to collapse. Additionally, the report found the towers' stairwells were not adequately reinforced to provide adequate [[Fire escape|emergency escape]] for people above the impact zones.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIST&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Translating WTC Recommendations Into Model Building Codes|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NIBS_MMC/CodeChangeProposals.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310004023/http://wtc.nist.gov/NIBS_MMC/CodeChangeProposals.htm|archivedate=March 10, 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2011 |date=October 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIST concluded that uncontrolled fires in 7&amp;nbsp;WTC caused floor beams and girders to heat and subsequently &quot;caused a critical support column to fail, initiating a fire-induced progressive collapse that brought the building down&quot;.&lt;ref name=seven /&gt;

The US iron and steel industry has paralleled the industry in other countries in technological developments. In the 1800s, the US switched from charcoal to coke in ore smelting, adopted the Bessemer process, and saw the rise of very large integrated steel mills. In the 20th century, the US industry successively adopted the [[open hearth furnace]], then the [[basic oxygen steelmaking]] process. Since the American industry peaked in the 1940s and 1950s, the US industry has shifted to small mini-mills and specialty mills, using iron and steel scrap as feedstock, rather than iron ore.   

==Colonial==

Iron manufacture before the 19th century required charcoal, and Britain’s once-vast forests could no longer supply enough charcoal for the nation’s increasing need for iron. By 1700, Britain was becoming increasingly dependent on iron imported from its sometimes-adversary Sweden. Britain looked to the seemingly limitless forests of its American colonies to supply Britain with iron. British investors started an iron furnace near [[Perryville, Maryland]], which in 1718 started exporting iron back to Britain. That success prompted formation of more companies, which built numerous iron furnaces around [[Chesapeake Bay]], supplied by [[bog iron]] ore, which was widespread. By 1751, [[Virginia]] and [[Maryland]] were exporting 2,950 tons of pig iron to Britain each year; at the time, British iron production was about 20,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Norman J. G. Pounds and William N Parker, Coal and Steel in Western Europe (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1957) 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the Chesapeake Bay furnaces were established for export, iron furnaces were established in the 1700s throughout the American colonies for domestic consumption. Iron furnaces were located along rivers to supply water power. Also required were forests for charcoal, iron ore, and limestone for flux. In addition, the furnace needed to be close to a major market or close to water transport.  

British business interests were split on colonial iron: manufacturers appreciated the lower prices due to colonial imports, but the British iron and steel industry objected to the competition. Parliament compromised in the [[Iron Act]] of 1750, which eliminated the import duty on colonial pig iron, but barred the manufacture of steel or of iron plate in the colonies. The law was widely ignored by colonial governments.

By 1776, up to 80 iron furnaces throughout the American colonies were producing about as much iron as Britain itself. If one estimate of 30,000 tons of iron each year is accurate, then the newly formed United States was the world’s third-largest iron producer, after Sweden and Russia.

==Early republic==

Because wood for charcoal was available throughout the eastern states, iron smelters were located close to iron ore. Although the bog iron ores mined in colonial days were widespread, the deposits were also small, and quickly exhausted. In the late 1700s the iron furnaces moved away from the bog iron ore of the coastal swamps, to larger iron ore deposits further inland. Inland locations also allowed the furnaces to be closer to sources of limestone, which was used as a flux in iron smelting. The proximity to larger ore deposits favored larger, more permanent iron smelters.&lt;ref&gt;US Geological Survey, 2001, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/silent/silent.pdf Silent reminders], Geologic Wonders of the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests, No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most US iron smelting before 1850 took place near iron deposits in eastern [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and northern [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;John S.Brown, &quot;Ore deposits of the northeastern United States,&quot; ''in'', John D. Ridge (ed.), ''Ore Deposits of the United States, 1933-1967'' (New York:American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1970) 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey's principal iron ore district, at [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]], supported iron smelters beginning in 1710. The [[Cornwall Iron Furnace]] in Pennsylvania was established next to an iron deposit. The Adirondack iron ore district of New York also supported iron smelters.&lt;ref&gt;Martha S. Carr and Carl E. Dutton, 1959, ''Iron-Ore Resources of the United States, Including Alaska and Puerto Rico'', US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1082-C, p.66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement away from charcoal in US iron smelting began in 1827, when a [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] furnace in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]] started using anthracite coal. [[Blast furnaces]] continued to use only charcoal until about 1840, when [[coke (fuel)|coke]] from [[coal]] started replacing charcoal as the fuel and reducing agent.&lt;ref&gt;James M. Swank, &quot;The manufacture of iron and steel in the United States,&quot; in: ''Mineral Resources of the United States, 1883 and 1884'', US Geological Survey, 1885, p.247.&lt;/ref&gt; Coke has a higher crushing strength than charcoal, allowing larger smelting furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Dennis, ''100 Years of Metallurgy'' (Chicago: Aldine, 1963) 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Because iron and steel-making at the time consumed more coal than iron ore, the steel mills moved closer to the coal mines to minimize transportation costs. A problem of coke was that it carried impurities such as sulfur, which degraded the quality of the steel. Although coke quickly became the dominant fuel for iron-smelting, in 1884 charcoal was still used to make ten percent of iron and steel in the US. The use of [[Charcoal iron|charcoal for steelmaking]] survived in the US on a small scale until 1945.

The [[Lackawanna River|Lackawanna Valley]] in [[Pennsylvania]] was rich in [[anthracite]] [[coal]] and [[iron]] deposits. Brothers [[George W. Scranton]] and [[Seldon T. Scranton]] moved to the valley in 1840 and settled in the five-house town of Slocum's Hollow (now Scranton) to establish an iron forge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeomans&quot;&gt;Yeomans, &quot;36 Hours: Scranton, Pa.,&quot; ''New York Times,'' November 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bitter&quot;&gt;&quot;The Bitter Battle,&quot; ''Time,'' October 19, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common processes for creating [[cementation process|blister steel]] and [[crucible steel]] were slow and extremely expensive. The Scrantons instead used the new &quot;[[hot blast]] method,&quot; developed in [[Scotland]] in 1828.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeomans&quot; /&gt; The hot blast method solved the problem of impurities from the coke, by burning them off. The Scrantons also experimented with anthracite to make steel, rather than [[charcoal]] or [[bituminous coal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;Lewis, &quot;The Early History of the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company: A Study in Technological Adaptation,&quot; ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography,'' October 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pittsburgh==

[[Image:Bethlehem Steel.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Bethlehem Steel]] in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] was one of the world's largest manufacturers of steel.]]
The replacement of charcoal with coke in the steel-making process revolutionized the industry, and tied steelmaking to coal-mining areas. In the 1800s, making a ton of steel required a greater weight of coal than iron ore.  Therefore, it was more economical to locate closer to the coal mines. Pittsburgh, surrounded by large coal deposits and at the junction of three navigable rivers, was an ideal location for steelmaking.

==Great Lakes ports==

The tremendous iron ore deposits around Lake Superior were located far from coal deposits, and so were shipped to ports on the southern Great Lakes that were closer to the coal mines of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Large integrated steel mills were built in Chicago, Gary, Cleveland, and Buffalo, to handle the Lake Superior ore. 

Cleveland's first blast furnace was built in 1859. In 1860, the steel mill employed 374 workers. By 1880, Cleveland was a major steel producer, with ten steel mills and 3,000 steelworkers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=IASI Iron and steel industry], Encyclopedia of Cleveland, accessed 5 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary, Indiana was founded in 1906 by [[United States Steel Corporation]] to serve the [[Gary Works]].

The [[Lackawanna Steel Company]] built a large integrated steel works near Buffalo, which began producing steel from Lake Superior ore in 1903. The company had made steel in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] since 1840, but moved to provide easier access to iron ore, and in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid labor troubles.

==Birmingham, Alabama==

Birmingham, Alabama became a major steel producer in the late 1800s, using locally mined coal and iron ore. The iron ore was mined from the Clinton Formation of Silurian age.

==World War II and after==

[[File:US Steelmaking Process Percentages 1950-2012.png|thumb|Percentages of US steelmaking processes, 1900-2012. Data from USGS and US Bureau of Mines Minerals Yearbooks]]
As the only major steel maker not harmed during the war, the United States iron and steel industry reached its maximum world importance during and just after World War II. In 1945, the US produced 67% of the world's pig iron, and 72% of the steel. By comparison, 2014 percentages were 2.4% of the pig iron, and 5.3% of the steel production.

Although US iron and steel output continued to grow overall through the 1950s and 1960s, the world steel industry grew much faster, and the US share of world production shrank. In the 1960s, the US became a major importer of steel, mostly from Japan.

==Contraction: 1979-1984==

US production of iron and steel peaked in 1973, when the US industry produced a combined total of 229 million metric tons of iron and steel. But US iron and steel production dropped drastically during the recession of the late 1970s and early 1980s. From a combined iron and steel production of 203 million tons in 1979, US output fell almost in half, to 107 million tons in 1982. Some steel companies declared bankruptcy, and many permanently closed steelmaking plants. By 1989, US combined iron and steel production recovered to 142 million tons, a much lower level than in the 1960s and 1970s.

The causes of the sudden decline are disputed. Among the many causes alleged have been: dumping of foreign imports below cost, high labor costs, poor management, unfavorable tax policies, and costs of environmental controls. One recent study found that hypotheses based on declining domestic production (such as foreign imports displacing domestic product) cannot explain the magnitude of the decline in employment, as shipments of domestic steel products in 2005 were similar to the level of the early 1960s, whereas employment in the domestic sector had plummeted by approximately 75% over the same time period. Instead, the majority of the losses could be accounted for by rising productivity, principally through technological efficiencies and the shift from traditional steel plants to [[mini mill]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CWL2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collard-Wexler|first1=Allan|last2=De Loecker|first2=Jan|title=Reallocation and Technology: Evidence from the US Steel Industry|journal=[[American Economic Review]]|date=January 2015|volume=105|issue=1|pages=131-71|doi=10.1257/aer.20130090|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130090|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleveland had nine integrated steel mills in the 1970s. US Steel closed one mill in 1979, then shut down its six remaining Cleveland mills in 1984. Cleveland's two remaining steel producers, [[Republic Steel]] and Jones &amp; Laughlin, merged to form LTV Steel in June 1984. LTV Steel declared bankruptcy in 2000. The operation, on both sides of the [[Cuyahoga River]], is Cleveland's last remaining integrated steel mill, now owned by [[Arcelor Mittal]].

==Transformation==

The number of integrated steel mills has continued to decline, and in 2014, only 11 integrated mills were operating in the US. Most of the steel produced has been by the growing number of mini-mills, also called specialty mills, which in 2014 numbered 113. In 1981, mini-mills produced an estimated 15% of US steel.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Chaves, [http://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/23/business/the-rise-of-mini-steel-mills.html &quot;The rise of mini steel mills,&quot;] ''New York Times'', 23 Sept. 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, steel produced by electric arc furnace, the process used by the mini-mills, has produced more than half the steel made in the US. Many companies operating integrated mills also have mini-mills.

A number of bankruptcies and acquisitions Between 2000 and 2014 reversed the trend of industry fragmentation. In 2000, the top three steelmakers ([[Nucor]], US Steel, and Bethlehem Steel) had 28% of the steelmaking capacity, and the top ten had 58%. By 2014, the top three (Nucor, ArcelorMittal, and US Steel) accounted for 56% of the steel capacity, and the top ten 87%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.arcelormittal.com/globalassets/arcelormittal-usa/publications-reports/2014-arcelormittalusa-factbook.pdf 2014 Arcelormittal USA Factbook].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of the United States}}

The '''California Republic''' was a short-lived, [[List of historical unrecognized states#Americas|unrecognized]] [[breakaway state]] that, for twenty-five days in 1846, militarily controlled the area to the [[North Coast (California)|north of the San Francisco Bay]] in the present-day state of [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V: 131–144&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1846, a number of [[Americans in Mexico|American immigrants]] in [[Alta California]] rebelled against the Mexican department's&lt;ref group=notes&gt;&quot;Department&quot; was a territorial and administrative designation used by Mexico’s centralized government under The Constitutional Laws of 1836.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richman p 261&lt;/ref&gt; government. The immigrants had not been allowed to buy or rent land and had been threatened with expulsion from California because they had [[illegal immigration|entered without official permission]].&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft; IV: 598–608&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Richman p 308&quot;&gt;Richman p 308&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexican officials were concerned about a coming war with the United States coupled with the growing influx of Americans into California.  The rebellion was soon overtaken by the beginning of the [[Mexican–American War]].

The name &quot;California Republic&quot; appeared only on the flag the insurgents raised in [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]].&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V:146&lt;/ref&gt; It indicated their aspiration of forming a republican government for California.  The insurgents elected military officers but no civil structure was ever established.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harlow p. 103&quot;&gt;Harlow p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  The flag featured an image of a [[California grizzly bear]] and became known as the [[Bear Flag]] and the revolt as the Bear Flag Revolt.

Three weeks later, on July 5, 1846, the Republic's military of 100 to 200 men was subsumed into the [[California Battalion]] commanded by U.S. Army Brevet Captain [[John C. Frémont]].  The Bear Flag Revolt and whatever remained of the &quot;California Republic&quot; ceased to exist on July 9 when U.S. Navy Lieutenant [[Joseph Warren Revere (general)|Joseph Revere]] raised the United States flag in front of the [[Sonoma Barracks]] and sent a second flag to be raised at [[Sutter's Fort]].&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V: 185-86&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of the Bear Flag Revolt==
[[File:Pío Pico cph.31737.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Pío Pico]]

===Alta California's Governance===

By 1845–46, Alta California had been largely neglected by [[Mexico]] for the twenty-five years since Mexican independence.  It had evolved into a semi-autonomous region with open discussions among [[Californio]]s about whether California should remain with Mexico; seek independence; or become annexed to the United Kingdom, France, or the United States. The 1845 removal of [[Manuel Micheltorena]], the latest governor to be sent by Mexico and forcefully ejected by the Californians, resulted in a divided government.  The region south of [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] was ruled by Governor [[Pio Pico]] with his capital in ''The Town of Our Lady the Queen of Angels of the Porciúncula River'', now known as  [[Los Angeles]].  The area to the north of the pueblo of [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] was under the control of Alta California's ''Commandante'' [[José Castro]] with headquarters near [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], the traditional capital and, significantly, the location of the [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|Customhouse]]. Pico and Castro disliked each other personally and soon began escalating disputes over control of the Customhouse income.&lt;ref&gt;Walker p. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

Decrees issued by the central government in Mexico City were often acknowledged and supported with proclamations but ignored in practice.  By the end of 1845, when rumors of a military force being sent from Mexico proved to be false, rulings by the other district government were mostly ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft IV:540–545&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas, immigration and land===
[[File:Polkpolk.jpg|175px|thumb|left|US President James K. Polk favored expansionist policies that led to the annexation of Texas and California.]]
The relationship between the United States and Mexico had been deteriorating for some time.  Texas, which Mexico still considered to be its territory, had been admitted to statehood in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Hague p 99&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexico had earlier threatened war if this happened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker p. 60&quot;&gt;Walker p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James K. Polk]] was elected President of the United States in 1844, and considered his election a mandate for his expansionist policies.&lt;ref&gt;Walker p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican law had long allowed grants of land to [[naturalized]] Mexican citizens.  Obtaining Mexican citizenship was not difficult and many earlier American immigrants had gone through the process and obtained free grants of land.  That same year (1845) anticipation of war with the United States and the increasing number of immigrants reportedly coming from the United States resulted in orders from Mexico City denying immigrants from the United States entry into California.&lt;ref&gt;Hague p.118&lt;/ref&gt;  The orders also required California's officials not to allow land grants, sales or even rental of land to non-citizen emigrants already in California.  All non-citizen immigrants, who had arrived without permission, were threatened with being forced out of California.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft; IV:598–608&lt;/ref&gt;  

Alta California's Sub-Prefect [[Francisco Guerrero (politician)|Francisco Guerrero]] had written to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]] that:
{{quote|a multitude of foreigners [having] come into California and bought fixed property [land], a right of [[Naturalization|naturalized foreigners]] only, he was under the necessity of notifying the authorities in each town to inform such purchasers that the transactions were invalid and they themselves subject to be expelled whenever the government might find it convenient.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richman p 308&quot;/&gt;}}

[[File:Jose Castro.jpg|150px|thumb|right|José Castro commanded Mexican military forces in Alta California.]]

During November 1845, California's ''Commandante General'' José Castro met with representatives of the 1845 American immigrants at Sonoma and Sutter’s Fort.  In his decree dated November 6 he wrote: &quot;Therefore conciliating my duty [to enforce the orders from Mexico] with of the sentiment of hospitality which distinguishes the Mexicans, and considering that most of said expedition is composed of families and industrious people, I have deemed it best to permit them, provisionally, to remain in the department&quot; with the conditions that they obey all laws, apply within three months for a license to settle, and promise to depart if that license was not granted.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft IV:p.606-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Captain Frémont in California===
[[File:John C. Fremont at National Portrait Gallery IMG 4410.JPG|175px|thumb|left|John C. Fremont]]
A 62-man exploring and mapping expedition entered California in late 1845 under the command of U.S. Army Brevet Captain [[John C. Frémont]]. Frémont was well known in the United States as an author and explorer. He was also the son-in-law of expansionist U.S. Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]]. Early in 1846 Frémont acted provocatively with California's ''Commandante General'' José Castro near the pueblo of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and then moved his group out of California into [[Oregon Country]]. He was followed into Oregon by U.S. Marine Lt [[Archibald H. Gillespie]] who had been sent from Washington with a secret message to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]] and instructions to share the message with Frémont. Gillespie also brought a packet of letters from Frémont's wife and father-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Hague p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Frémont's thoughts (as related in his book, written forty years later) after reading the message and letters were: &quot;I saw the way opening clear before me.  War with Mexico was inevitable; and a grand opportunity presented itself to realize in their fullest extent the far-sighted views of Senator Benton. I resolved to move forward on the opportunity and return forthwith to the [[Sacramento valley]] in order to bring to bear all the influence I could command.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frémont p. 490&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, Frémont needed to be circumspect. As a military officer he could face [[court-martial]] for violating the [[Neutrality Act of 1794]] that made it illegal for an American to wage war against another country at peace with the United States. The next morning Gillespie and Frémont's group departed for California.  Frémont returned to the Sacramento Valley and set up camp near [[Sutter Buttes]].&lt;ref&gt;Harlow p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===USS ''Portsmouth'' in the San Francisco Bay===
[[File:USS Portsmouth-Full Sail.jpg|150px|thumb|right|USS ''Portsmouth'']]
U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]], concerned about the increasing possibility of war, sent a request to [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[John D. Sloat]] of U.S. Navy's [[Pacific Squadron]], for a warship to protect U.S. citizens and interests in [[Alta California]].  In response, the [[USS Portsmouth|USS ''Portsmouth'']] arrived at [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] on April 22, 1846.   After receiving information about Frémont's returning to California, Consul Larkin and ''Portsmouth's'' captain [[John Berrien Montgomery]] decided the ship should move into the [[San Francisco Bay]]. She sailed from Monterey on June 1.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers ''Montgomery'' p. 21-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Lt. Gillespie, having returned from the [[Oregon Country]] and his meeting with Frémont on June 7, found ''Portsmouth'' moored at [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]]. He carried a request for money, materiel and supplies for Frémont's group.  The requested resupplies were taken by the ship's launch up the [[Sacramento River]] to a location near Frémont's camp.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''Montgomery'' p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bear Flag Revolt==
[[File:William B. Ide?.gif|175px|thumb|left|William B. Ide]]

===Settlers meet with Frémont===
[[William B. Ide]], a future leader of the Revolt, writes of receiving an unsigned written message on June 8, 1846:  &quot;Notice is hereby given, that a large body of armed Spaniards on horseback, amounting to 250 men, have been seen on their way to the Sacramento Valley, destroying crops and burning houses, and driving off the cattle.  Capt. Fremont invites every freeman in the valley to come to his camp at the Butts [sic], immediately; and he hopes to stay the enemy and put a stop to his&quot; – (Here the sheet was folded and worn in-two, and no more is found).&lt;ref&gt;Ide p. 112-3&lt;/ref&gt;  Ide and other settlers quickly traveled to Frémont's camp but were generally dissatisfied by the lack of a specific plan and their inability to obtain from Frémont any definite promise of aid.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V:104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taking of government horses===
Some of the group who had been meeting with Frémont departed from his camp and, on June 10, 1846, captured a herd of 170 Mexican government-owned horses being moved by ''[[Californio]]'' soldiers from San Rafael and Sonoma to the Californian ''Commandante General'', [[José Castro]], in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]].  It had been reported amongst the emigrants that the officer in charge of the herd had made statements threatening that the horses would be used by Castro to drive the foreigners out of California.  The captured horses were taken to Frémont’s new camp at the junction of the Feather and Bear rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V:101–108&lt;/ref&gt;

These men next determined to seize the ''pueblo'' of Sonoma to deny the ''Californios'' a rallying point north of [[San Francisco Bay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bancroft V:109&quot;&gt;Bancroft V:109&lt;/ref&gt;  Capturing both the arms and military materiel stored in the unmanned [[Presidio of Sonoma]] and Mexican Lieutenant Colonel [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]] would delay any military response from the ''Californios''.  The insurgent group was nominally led by Ezekiel &quot;Stuttering&quot; Merritt, whom Frémont described as his &quot;field-lieutenant&quot; and lauded for not questioning him.&lt;ref&gt;Frémont p. 509&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CSMM&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capture of Sonoma===
[[File:BearFlagMonument.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Bear Flag monument in Sonoma]]
Historian George Tays has cautioned “The description of the men, their actions just prior and subsequent to the taking of Sonoma, are as varied as the number of authors.  No two accounts agree, and it is impossible to determine the truth of their statements.” &lt;ref&gt;Tays p.240 Note 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Before dawn on Sunday, June 14, 1846, over thirty American insurgents arrived at the pueblo of Sonoma. They had traveled overnight from Napa Valley.  A majority of their number had started a couple of days earlier from Fremont’s camp in the Sacramento valley but others had joined the group along the way. Meeting no resistance, they approached ''Comandante'' Vallejo's home and pounded on his door.  After a few minutes Vallejo opened the door dressed in his Mexican Army uniform.  Communication was not good until American [[Jacob P. Leese]] (Vallejo’s brother-in-law) was summoned to translate.&lt;ref&gt;Harlow p.98-99&lt;/ref&gt;

Vallejo then invited the [[Filibuster (military)|filibusters']] leaders into his home to negotiate terms.  Two other Californio officers and [[Jacob P. Leese|Leese]] joined the negotiations.  The insurgents waiting outside sent elected &quot;captains&quot; John Grigsby and William Ide inside to speed the proceedings.  The effect of Vallejo's hospitality in the form of wine and brandy for the negotiators and someone else's barrel of ''[[aguardiente]]'' for those outside is debatable.  However, when the agreement was presented to those outside they refused to endorse it.  Rather than releasing the Mexican officers under parole they insisted they be held as hostages.  John Grigsby refused to remain as leader of the group, stating he had been deceived by Frémont.  [[William B. Ide|William Ide]] gave an impassioned speech urging the rebels to stay in Sonoma and start a new republic.&lt;ref&gt;Walker p. 125-6&lt;/ref&gt;  Referring to the stolen horses Ide ended his oration with &quot;Choose ye this day what you will be!  We are robbers, or we ''must'' be conquerors!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harlow p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, Vallejo and his three associates were placed on horseback and taken to Frémont accompanied by eight or nine of the insurgents who did not favor forming a new republic under the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V:117&lt;/ref&gt; That night they camped at the Vaca Rancho.  Some young Californio ''vigilantes'' under Juan Padilla evaded the guards, aroused Vallejo and offered to help him escape.  Vallejo declined, wanting to avoid any bloodshed and anticipating that Frémont would release him on parole.&lt;ref&gt;Harlow p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sonoma Barracks]] became the headquarters for the remaining twenty-four rebels, who within a few days created their Bear Flag (see the &quot;Bear Flag&quot; section below). After the flag was raised [[Californio]]s called the insurgents ''Los Osos'' (The Bears) because of their flag and in derision of their often scruffy appearance.  The rebels embraced the expression, and their uprising, which they originally called the ''Popular Movement'', became known as the ''Bear Flag Revolt''.&lt;ref&gt;SSHP p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry L. Ford was elected First Lieutenant of the company and obtained promises of obedience to orders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harlow p. 103&quot;/&gt;  Samuel Kelsey was elected Second Lieutenant, Grandville P. Swift and Samuel Gibson Sergeants.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V:158&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ide's proclamation ===

William B. Ide wrote a proclamation announcing and explaining the reasons for the revolt during the night of June 14–15, 1846 (below).  There were additional copies and some more moderate versions (produced in both English and Spanish) distributed around northern California through June 18.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''Ide'' p. 82, Appendix A&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation
|To all persons, citizens of Sonoma, requesting them to remain at peace, and to follow their rightful occupations without fear of molestation.

The Commander in Chief of the Troops assembled at the Fortress of Sonoma gives his inviolable pledge to all persons in California not found under arms that they shall not be disturbed in their persons, their property or social relations one to another by men under his command.

He also solemnly declares his object to be First, to defend himself and companions in arms who were invited to this country by a promise of Lands on which to settle themselves and families who were also promised a &quot;republican government,&quot; who, when having arrived in California were denied even the privilege of buying or renting Lands of their friends, who instead of being allowed to participate in or being protected by a &quot;Republican Government&quot; were oppressed by a &quot;Military Despotism,&quot; who were even threatened, by &quot;Proclamation&quot; from the Chief Officer of the aforesaid Despotism, with extermination if they would not depart out of the Country, leaving all of their property, their arms and beasts of burden, and thus deprived of the means of flight or defense. We were to be driven through deserts, inhabited by hostile Indians to certain destruction. To overthrow a Government which has seized upon the property of the Missions for its individual aggrandizement; which has ruined and shamefully oppressed the laboring people of California, by their enormous exactions on goods imported into this country; is the determined purpose of the brave men who are associated under his command.

He also solemnly declares his object in the Second place to be to invite all peaceable and good Citizens of California who are friendly to the maintenance of good order and equal rights (and I do hereby invite them to repair to my camp at Sonoma without delay) to assist us in establishing and perpetuating a &quot;Republican Government&quot; which shall secure to all: civil and religious liberty; which shall detect and punish crime; which shall encourage industry, virtue and literature; which shall leave unshackled by Fetters, Commerce, Agriculture, and Mechanism.

He further declares that he relies upon the rectitude of our intentions; the favor of Heaven and the bravery of those who are bound to and associated with him, by the principle of self preservation; by the love of truth; and by the hatred of tyranny for his hopes of success.

He further declares that he believes that a Government to be prosperous and happyfying [sic] in its tendency must originate with its people who are friendly to its existence. That its Citizens are its Guardians, its officers are its Servants, and its Glory their reward.  |William B. Ide|Head Quarters Sonoma|June 15, 1846

===Need for gunpowder===
A major problem for the Bears in Sonoma was the lack of sufficient [[gunpowder]] to defend against the expected Mexican attack.  William Todd was dispatched on Monday the fifteenth, with a letter&lt;ref group=notes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/June%2015_1846%20William%20B%20Ide%20Letter%20to%20Stockton%20Montgomery.html |title=Ide's Letter |date= June 15, 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be delivered to the [[USS Portsmouth (1843)|USS Portsmouth]] telling of the events in Sonoma and describing themselves as &quot;fellow country men&quot;. Todd, having been instructed not to repeat any of the requests in the letter (refers to their need for gunpowder), disregarded that and voiced the request for gunpowder.  Captain Montgomery, while sympathetic, declined because of his country's neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V:156&lt;/ref&gt;  Todd, José de Rosa (the messenger Vallejo sent to Montgomery), and U.S. Navy Lieutenant John S. Misroon returned to Sonoma in the Portsmouth's launch the morning of the 16th.  Misroon's mission was, without interfering with the revolt, to prevent violence to noncombatants.&lt;ref&gt;Harlow p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd was given a second assignment.  He was sent to Bodega Bay with an unnamed companion (sometimes call 'the Englishman') to obtain powder from American settlers in that area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker p. 132&quot;&gt;Walker p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 18, Bears Thomas Cowie and George Fowler were sent to ''Rancho Sotoyome'' (near current-day [[Healdsburg, California]]) to pick up a cache of gunpowder from Moses Carson, brother of Frémont's scout [[Kit Carson]].&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft p. 155-59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sutter's Fort===
[[File:Sutter's Fort colored engraving 1849.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Sutter's Fort]]
Frémont's &quot;field-lieutenant&quot; Merritt returned to Sacramento on June 16 with his prisoners and recounted the events in Sonoma. Frémont either was fearful of going against the popular sentiment at Sonoma or saw the advantages of holding the ''Californio'' officers as hostages.  He also decided to imprison Governor Vallejo's brother-in-law, the American Jacob Leese, in Sutter's Fort.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V:120-21&lt;/ref&gt;  Frémont recounts in his memoirs, &quot;Affairs had now assumed a critical aspect and I presently saw that the time had come when it was unsafe to leave events to mature under unfriendly, or mistaken, direction … I knew the facts of the situation.  These I could not make known, but felt warranted in assuming the responsibility and acting on my own knowledge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frémont p. 520&lt;/ref&gt;

Frémont's artist and cartographer on his third expedition, [[Edward Kern]], was placed in command of Sutter's Fort and its company of dragoons by Frémont. &lt;ref name=fortsutter&gt;[http://californiamilitaryhistory.org/Sutter.html Californiamilitaryhistory.org: Historic California Posts — Sutter's Fort (Fort New Helvatia, Fort Sacramento)]&lt;/ref&gt; That left [[John Sutter]] the assignment as lieutenant of the dragoons at $50 a month, and second in command of his own fort. &lt;ref name=fortsutter/&gt;

While in command there news of the stranded [[Donner Party]] reached Kern; Sutter's Fort had been their unreached destination.&lt;ref name=donner&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R-iMMtwprxoC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=Edward+Kern+Donner+money&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QitFLmUjI6&amp;sig=Qpps14d-O-rOeSq4yvLkzW1e-FU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwA2oVChMIx7LC46mMyAIV0fqACh0gCQFT#v=onepage&amp;q=Edward%20Kern%20Donner%20money&amp;f=false  Google Books: &quot;Desperate Passage: The Donner Party's Perilous Journey West&quot;], by Ethan Rarick, pg. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Kern vaguely promised the federal government would do something for a rescue party across the Sierra, but had no authority to pay anyone. &lt;ref name=donner/&gt; He was later criticized for his mismanagement delaying the search.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xmission.com/~octa/DonnerParty/Rescuers.htm#Kern Xmission.com: The Donner Party: Rescuers and Others]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xmission.com/~octa/DonnerParty/FirstReliefDiary.htm#behavior%20of%20Lt.%20Kern Xmission.com: The Donner Party: First Relief Diary]; article about Kern's behavior as fund administrator for Donner Party relief.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castro's response===
Word of the taking of the government horses, the capture of Sonoma, and the imprisonment of the Mexican officers at [[Sutter's Fort]] soon reached ''Commandante General'' [[José Castro]] at his headquarters in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]].  He issued two proclamations on June 17.  The first asked the citizens of California to come to the aid of their country.  The second promised protection for all foreigners not involved in the revolt.  A group of 50–60 militia under command of Captain [[Rancho Arroyo Seco (Torre)|Joaquin de la Torre]] traveled up to [[San Pablo, California|San Pablo]] and, by boat, westward across the [[San Francisco Bay]] to [[San Quentin, California|Point San Quentin]] on the 23rd.  Two additional divisions with a total of about 100 men arrived at San Pablo on June 27.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bancroft V:132-136&quot;&gt;Bancroft V:132–136&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Olúmpali===
On June 20 when the procurement parties failed to return as expected, Lieutenant Ford sent Sergeant Gibson with four men to ''Rancho Sotoyome''.  Gibson obtained the powder and on the way back fought with several Californians and captured one of them.  From the prisoner they learned of the deaths of Cowie and Fowler.  There are [[Californio]] and ''Oso'' versions of what had happened.  Ford also learned that William Todd and his companion had been captured by the [[Californio]] irregulars led by Juan Padilla and José Ramón Carrillo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker p. 132&quot;/&gt;  

Ford writes, in his biography, that before leaving Sonoma to search for the other two captives and Padilla's men, he sent a note to Ezekiel Merritt in Sacramento asking him to gather volunteers to help defend Sonoma.  Ide's version is that Ford wrote to Frémont saying that the Bears had lost confidence in Ide's leadership.  In either case, Ford then rode toward Santa Rosa with seventeen to nineteen Bears.  Not finding Padilla, the Bears headed toward one of his homes near [[Two Rock, California|Two Rock]].  The following morning the Bears captured three or four men near the [[Rancho Laguna de San Antonio]] and unexpectedly discovered what they assumed was Juan Padilla's group near the Indian rancho of [[Olumpali, California|Olúmpali]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harlow p. 108-9&quot;&gt;Harlow p. 108-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford approached the adobe but more men appeared and others came &quot;pouring out of the adobe&quot;.  Militiamen from south of the Bay, led by Mexican Captain Joaquin de la Torre, had joined with Padilla's irregulars and now numbered about seventy.  Ford's men positioned themselves in a grove of trees and opened fire when the enemy charged on horseback, killing one Californio and wounding another. During the ensuing long-range battle, William Todd and his companion escaped from the house where they were being held and ran to the Bears. The Californios disengaged from the ensuing long-range fighting after suffering a few wounded and returned to San Rafael.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: Ide p.51&lt;/ref&gt; A Californian militiaman reported that their muskets could not shoot as far as the rifles used by some Bears.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft v:166 note 15&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only battle fought during the Bear Flag Revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Walker p. 132-35&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaths of Cowie and Fowler, as well as the lethal battle, raised the anxiety of both the Californios, who left the area for safety, and the immigrants, who moved into Sonoma to be under the protection of the muskets and cannon that had been taken from the [[Sonoma Barracks]]. This increased the number in Sonoma to about two hundred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bancroft V:109&quot;&gt;Bancroft V:109&lt;/ref&gt; Some immigrant families were housed in the Barracks, others in the homes of the Californios.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harlow p. 108-9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warner p. 479-482 Appendix VII&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frémont arrives to defend Sonoma===
[[File:Historic American Buildings Survey George Gibbs Drawing of 1851 Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collection VIEW FROM WEST - Sonoma Plaza, Bear Flag Flagstaff, Sonoma, Sonoma County, CA HABS CAL,49-SONO,7-1.tif|300px|thumb|left|Sonoma]]
Having learned of Ford's request for volunteers to defend Sonoma and hearing reports that General Castro was preparing an attack, Frémont left his camp near Sutter's Fort for Sonoma on June 23.  With him were ninety men – his own party plus trappers and settlers under Samuel J. Hensley.  Frémont would say in his memoirs that he wrote a letter of resignation from the Army and sent it to his father-in-law [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]] in case the government should wish to disavow his action.  They arrived at Sonoma in the early morning of the 25th and by noon were on their way to [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] accompanied by a contingent of Bears under Ford's command.  They arrived at the former San Rafael mission but the Californios had vanished.  The rebels set up camp in the old mission and sent out scouting parties.&lt;ref&gt;Harlow p, 108–110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker p. 134-5&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday the 28th a small boat was spotted coming across the bay.  Kit Carson and some companions went to intercept it.  It held twin brothers Francisco and Ramón de Haro, their uncle José de la Reyes Berreyesa, and an oarsman (probably one of the Castro brothers from San Pablo) – all unarmed.  The Haro brothers and Berreyesa were dropped off at the shoreline and started on foot for the mission.  All three were shot and killed.  Beyond that almost every fact is disputed.  Some say Frémont ordered the killings.  Others, that they were carrying secret messages from Castro to Torre.  Others that Carson committed the homicides as revenge for the deaths of Cowie and Fowler or they were shot by Frémont's Delaware Indians.  This incident became an issue in Frémont's later campaign for President.  Partisan eyewitnesses and newspapers related totally conflicting stories.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V:171-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harlow p.110&lt;/ref&gt;

===Captain de la Torre's ruse===
Late the same afternoon as the killings a scouting party intercepted a letter indicating that Torre intended to attack Sonoma the following morning.  Frémont felt there was no choice but to return to defend Sonoma as quickly as possible.  The garrison there had found a similar letter and had all weapons loaded and at the ready before dawn the next day when Frémont and Ford's forces approached Sonoma – almost provoking firing by the garrison.  Frémont, understanding that he had been tricked, left again for San Rafael after a hasty breakfast.  He arrived back at the old mission within twenty-four hours of leaving but during that period Torre and his men had time to escape to San Pablo via boat.  Torre had successfully used the ruse not only to escape  but almost succeeded in provoking a 'friendly fire' incident among the insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V;174-6&lt;/ref&gt;

After reaching San Pablo, Torre reported that the combined rebel force was too strong to be attacked as planned.  All three of Castro's divisions then returned to the old headquarters near [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] where a council of war was held on June 30.  It was decided that the current plan must be abandoned and any new approach would require the cooperation of Pio Pico and his southern forces.  A messenger was sent to the Governor.  Meanwhile, the army moved southwards to [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan]] where General Castro was on July 6 when he learned of the events in Monterey.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V:136&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions in and around Yerba Buena===
On July 1, Frémont and twelve men convinced Captain William Phelps to ferry them in the ''Moscow'''s launch to the [[Fort Point, San Francisco|old Spanish fort]] at the entrance to the [[Golden Gate]].  They landed without resistance and spiked the ten old, abandoned cannon.  The next day [[Robert B. Semple]] led ten Bears in the launch to the pueblo of [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (the future San Francisco) to arrest the naturalized Englishman Robert Ridley who was captain of the port.  Ridley was sent to Sutter's Fort to be locked up with other prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Harlow p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence Day, 1846, in Sonoma===

A great celebration was held on the [[Fourth of July]] beginning with readings of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in Sonoma's plaza.  There were also cannon salutes, the roasting of whole beeves, and the consumption of many foods and all manner of beverages.  Frémont and the contingent from San Rafael arrived in time for the [[fandango]] held in Salvador Vallejo's big adobe on the corner of the town square.&lt;ref&gt;Walker p. 138-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of the California Battalion===

On July 5, Frémont called a public meeting and proposed to the Bears that they unite with his party and form a single military unit.  He said that he would accept command if they would pledge obedience, proceed honorably, and not violate the chastity of women. A compact was drawn up which all volunteers of the [[California Battalion]] signed or made their marks.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V:178-80&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of those present also agreed to officially date the era of independence not from the taking of Sonoma but from July 5 to allow Frémont to &quot;begin at the beginning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harlow p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day Frémont, leaving the fifty men of Company B at the Barracks to defend Sonoma, left with the rest of the Battalion for Sutter's Fort. They took with them two of the captured Mexican field pieces, as well as muskets, a supply of ammunition, blankets, horses, and cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V:184-5&lt;/ref&gt;  The seven-ton ''Mermaid'' was used for transporting the cannon, arms, ammunition and saddles from Napa to Sutter's Fort.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers: Ide p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

===U. S. Navy captures Monterey===
War against Mexico had already been declared by the United States Congress on May 13, 1846.  Because of the slow cross-continent communication of the time, no one in California knew that conclusively.  (Official notice of the war finally reached California on August 12, 1846.)&lt;ref&gt;Harlow p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[John D. Sloat]], commanding the U.S. Navy's [[Pacific Squadron]], had been waiting in [[Monterey Bay]] since July 1 or 2 to obtain convincing proof of war.  Sloat was 65 years old and had requested to be relieved from his command the previous May.  He was also acutely aware of the 1842 [[Capture of Monterey]], when his predecessor, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]], thought war had been declared and captured the capital of Alta California, only to discover his error and abandon it the next day.  This resulted in diplomatic problems, and Jones was removed as commander of the Pacific Squadron.

Sloat had learned of Frémont's confrontation with the Californios on [[Fremont Peak (California)|Gavilan Peak]] and of his support for the Bears in Sonoma.  He was also aware of Lt. Gillespie's  tracking down of Frémont with letters and orders.  Sloat finally concluded on July 6 that he needed to act, saying to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin|Larkin]], &quot;I shall be blamed for doing too little or too much – I prefer the latter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harlow p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  Early July 7, the [[frigate]] [[USS Savannah (1842)|USS ''Savannah'']] and the two [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]], [[USS Cyane (1837)|USS ''Cyane'']] and [[USS Levant (1837)|USS ''Levant'']] of the [[United States Navy]], captured [[Monterey, California]], and raised the flag of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/biographies/john_sloat.html &quot;Commodore John Sloat&quot;]. ''US-Mexican War'', [[Public Broadcasting Service]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Sloat had his proclamation read in and posted in English and Spanish: &quot;...henceforth California will be a portion of the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harlow p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusion and aftermath===
Two days later, July 9, the Bear Flag Revolt and whatever remained of the &quot;California Republic&quot; ended when Navy Lieutenant [[Joseph Warren Revere (general)|Joseph Revere]] was sent to Sonoma from the [[USS Portsmouth (1843)|USS ''Portsmouth'']], which had been berthed at [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]], carrying two 27-star United States flags, one for Sonoma and the other for Sutter's Fort (the squadron had run out of new 28-star flags that reflected Texas' [[admittance to the Union]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft V:185-86&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bear Flag that was taken down that day was given to the Clerk of the ''Portsmouth'', John Elliott Montgomery, the son of Commander [[John B. Montgomery]].  John E. wrote to his mother later in July that &quot;Cuffy came down growling&quot;.  The following November, John and his older brother disappeared while traveling to Sacramento and were presumed deceased. Commander Montgomery kept the Bear Flag, had a copy made, and eventually both were delivered to the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]. In 1855 the Secretary sent both flags to the Senators from California who donated them to the Society of Pioneers in San Francisco.  The original Bear Flag was destroyed in the fires following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bear Flag Museum|title=History of the Bear Flag|url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A replica, created in 1896 for the 50th Anniversary celebrations, is on display at the [[Sonoma Barracks]].

[[File:Flag of California.svg|right|thumb|175px|Modern flag of the State of California, for comparison]]

The most notable legacy of the &quot;California Republic&quot; was the adoption of its flag as the basis of the modern state [[Flag of California]]. The flag has a star, a [[grizzly bear]], and a colored stripe with the words &quot;California Republic.&quot; The ''[[Bear Flag Monument]]'' on the [[Sonoma Plaza]], site of the raising of the original Bear Flag, is marked by a [[California Historical Landmark]] #7.

The design and creation of the original Bear Flag used in the Bear Flag Revolt is often credited to Peter Storm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bearflagmuseum.blogspot.nl/2009/11/peter-storm-his-bear-flag.html Bear Flag Museum, &quot;Peter Storm and His Bear Flag.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Flags of the World, &quot;Storm Bear Flag, California&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The flags were made about one week before the storming of Sonoma, when William Todd and his companions claim to have made theirs, apparently based on Mr. Storm's first flags.

In 1878, at the request of the Los Angeles ''Evening Express'', William Todd wrote an account of the Bear Flag used at the storming of Sonoma, perhaps the first to be raised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH18780113.2.3&amp;srpos=5&amp;e=--1878---1879-187-en--20--1-byDA-txt-txIN-Bear+flag-------1 &quot;A Note from the Painter of the Original Bear Flag,&quot; Los Angeles Herald, Volume 9, Number 41, 13 January 1878].&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, his implementation became the basis for the first official State flag.  William L. Todd (1818–1879) was the cousin of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] (1818–1882),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/JHusseyArticle.html |title=Bear Flag Museum| accessdate= June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; wife of future American president [[Abraham Lincoln]].  Todd acknowledged the contributions of other ''Osos'' to the flag, including [[Granville P. Swift]], Peter Storm, and Henry L. Ford in an 1878 [http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/ToddinLAExpress1878.html newspaper article].   Todd painted the flag on domestic cotton cloth, roughly a yard and a half in length. It featured a red star based on the [[Flag of California#California Lone Star Flag|California Lone Star Flag]] that was flown during California's 1836 revolt led by [[Juan Alvarado]] and [[Isaac Graham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;flags over ca&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title = Flags over California, A History and Guide| place = Sacramento | publisher = State of California, Military Department | year = 2002 | url = http://www.militarymuseum.org/Flags_Over_Ca.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag also featured an image of a grizzly bear [[attitude_(heraldry)#Salient|salient]] or [[attitude_(heraldry)#Rampant|rampant]] (standing). The modern flag shows the bear [[attitude_(heraldry)#Passant|passant]] (walking).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="120728">The following '''list of worker deaths in United States labor disputes''' captures known incidents of fatal labor-related violence in U.S. labor history, which began in the colonial era with the [[Timeline of labor issues and events|earliest worker demands]] around 1636 for better working conditions. According to a study in 1969, the United States has had the bloodiest and most violent labor history of any industrial nation in the world, and there have been few industries which have been immune.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, &quot;American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome,&quot; The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

This list is not comprehensive. A number of factors (multi-sided conflicts, physically remote locations, company-controlled locations, exaggerated or biased original reporting, etc.) make some of the death and injury counts uncertain.

During an attempt by the miners to unionize, and following the murder of [[Sid Hatfield]], 10,000 armed coal miners confronted 3000 lawmen and [[Baldwin-Felts]] strikebreakers, who were backed by coal mine operators. In the summer of 1921 in [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo County]], hundreds of miners were arrested without [[habeas corpus]] and other basic legal rights.

By August 29, battle was fully joined. Chafin's men, though outnumbered, had the advantage of higher positions and better weaponry. Private hired planes dropped homemade bombs on the miners near the towns of Jeffery, Sharples and Blair. Army bombers were used for aerial surveillance.  Sporadic gun battles continued for a week. Up to 30 deaths were reported by Chafin's side and 50–100 on the union miners' side, with hundreds more injured. On September 2, federal troops arrived by presidential order, and the miners started heading home the next day. About one million rounds were fired in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2015-09-13|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1201/features/blair_mountain_coal_activism_west_virginia.html|volume=65|number=1|date=January–February 2012|first=Samir S.|last=Patel|title=Mountaintop Rescue – Archaeology, coal, and activism collide in the Appalachian Mountains at the site of America's largest labor conflict|work=Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Three members of the [[Coal and Iron Police]] beat miner [[John Barkoski]] to death. He had gone to his mother-in-law's home and there fell into the hands of two coal and iron policemen employed by the Pittsburgh Coal Company. Eyewitnesses said one of them had launched an unprovoked attack on Barkoski, who received a laceration of the left cheek, five or six head wounds, two broken ribs and a fractured nose. Later at police barracks over the course of four hours, according to trial testimony, a third officer beat Barkoski with a strap while he lay semiconscious on the floor, twisted his ears until the miner cried aloud, and twisted his broken nose until he lapsed again into unconsciousness. Then he beat Barkoski over the chest with a poker until the poker bent, straightened the implement and beat the man again. He stripped the miner to the waist in order to better use a strap and kicked Barkoski until the miner's body rolled over and over on the floor. The original attacker also beat Barkoski, kicked him, struck him over the head with knucklers, and slapped him on the arms and legs and neck with his blackjack.  The next morning he was taken to a hospital where he died. A jury acquitted the three officers of murder.&lt;ref name=ww/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Frank|last= Butler|title=Coal and Iron Justice|work=The Nation|date=October 16, 1929|url=http://explorepahistory.com/odocument.php?docId=1-4-29A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of the organization came in 1841. The organization transmuted further from other later war fighting groups like &quot;The General Society of the War of 1812,&quot; &quot; The Grand Army of the Republic,&quot; and &quot;The Order of Indian Wars.&quot; These all had the same general philosophy, so had a common ground.&lt;ref name=TWS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://navy.togetherweserved.com/usn/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?cmd=AssocByShortName&amp;name=76 |title=The Army and Navy Union USA |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2003-2011 |website= Military National |publisher=Together We Served |access-date=October 10, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1886, it was realized that these exclusive organizations would naturally become extinct due to deaths if something wasn’t done to give them new life.

They founded the Army and Navy Union of the United States of America that was open to all who had served honorably in the United States Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=TWS/&gt;

'''Claude Ewing Rusk''' (November 20, 1871 – February 3, 1931), also known as '''C. E. Rusk''', was an American [[mountaineer]], [[lawyer]], and [[author]] from [[Washington (state)|Washington]] who pioneered routes up [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]], [[Mount Baker]], and [[Glacier Peak]]. He also ascended many other peaks in Washington, [[Oregon]], and [[California]].

==Personal life==

===Early life===
Rusk was born on November 20, 1871 in [[Knox County, Illinois]] to James A. and Josie A. Rusk.{{sfn|Lyman|1919}} His family emigrated from [[Illinois]] to [[Washington Territory]] in the fall of 1874. They settled in eastern [[Klickitat County]] in an area known as Wood Gulch. In 1878, Rusk’s only sibling, Leah, was born. Several years later, in 1879, they moved to the foot of the [[Columbia Hills (Washington)|Columbia Hills]] in the lower [[Klickitat Valley]] near Warwick. Over the next year, Rusk’s father built the Happy Home stage station. Rusk often went to the top of the Columbia Hills to gaze at the various peaks of the [[Cascade Range]]. They lived in this place until Rusk was 15. They then moved to a homestead on the banks of the [[Klickitat River]] near Soda Springs in January 1887.{{sfn|Lloyd|1978}}{{sfn|Lyman|1919}}

===Career===
Rusk had received a public school education and in 1888, when he was 17, he began his career, teaching school at Camas Prairie in the [[Glenwood, Klickitat County, Washington|Glenwood]] Valley. Later, he taught at the Crossroads School outside [[Goldendale, Washington|Goldendale]] until 1892 when he became the editor of the ''Goldendale Courier''. This he did for a year and went back to teaching the next year. He also began studying law in the office of Nelson B. Brooks and Snover at about the same time. On October 30, 1898, Rusk married Rachel N. Gilmore, also the child of pioneers. In 1902, Rusk completed his law training and was admitted to the [[Washington State Bar Association]]. Also in 1902, Rusk became one of the founding members of the [[American Alpine Club]]. Rusk and his wife moved to [[Hamilton, Washington]] in 1903, but only stayed there for about a year before they moved to [[Lake Chelan]] and bought a home along a remote portion of the lake. Rusk became a member of the [[Mazamas]] club in 1904. Rusk practiced law in the town of [[Chelan, Washington|Chelan]] until 1910. While they were living on Lake Chelan, on June 10, 1905, their only son, Rodney L. Rusk, was born.{{sfn|Lloyd|1978}}{{sfn|Lyman|1919}}{{sfn|ObitA|1931}}{{sfn|ObitB|1931}}

In 1910, Rusk led an expedition to [[Mount McKinley]] and when he returned, they moved to the area of [[Grants Pass, Oregon|Grants Pass]] in [[Oregon]] where his parents were living. There, he helped his parents, working in their Lucky Spot gold mine. In 1912, he moved back to Washington, to the [[Yakima River|Yakima Valley]]. He became the editor of the ''[[Benton Independent]]'' published in [[Prosser, Washington|Prosser]], a position he held for a year before selling the paper and resuming law practice. He continued his practice until the spring of 1915 when he was appointed to a four-year term as the receiver for the [[United States Land Office]] in [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]]. During his time in the Yakima Valley, Rusk became a vocal conservationist. He was an admirer of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and started a local campaign to get [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] set aside as a national park. He felt that it was high time that it got the recognition it deserved and in 1919, he wrote the short booklet ''Mount Adams–Towering Sentinel of the Lower Columbia Basin'', in which he laid out his case for the [[Yakima National Park]] as he called it. In 1920, Rusk was a founding member of the [[Cascadians]] mountaineering club and became its first president. Later, he also served as the chairman of the outing committee.{{sfn|Coursen|1921}} Some of his closest friends he met while a member of the club.{{sfn|Lloyd|1978}}{{sfn|Lyman|1919}} In 1922, the members of the Cascadians presented Rusk with a Swiss [[ice-axe]] as a gift for being an inspiring leader and being the first president of the club.{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=266-284}}

===Later life===
Rusk’s father died in 1923 and Rusk moved back to Grants Pass. After the move, he started up his law practice again. In 1924, he wrote ''Tales of a Western Mountaineer'', his only published book. Some time after his first book was published, Rusk wrote another book, ''Timberline Campfires''. This collection of essays and short stories was never published except for one chapter, &quot;The Wonderful Story of Abe Lincoln,&quot; which was published in the ''American Alpine Journal'' in 1946. After some time in Grants Pass, Rusk was appointed to the position of [[justice of the peace]]. He was known to be quite the [[prohibitionist]] and would  [[wiktionary:throw the book at|throw the book at]] [[Rum-running|bootlegger]]s. In addition to being justice of the peace, Rusk worked his father’s Lucky Spot mine on the weekends, walking 14 miles there and back. In 1930, Rusk attempted to organize an expedition to [[Mount St. Elias]]; however, no one else was able to go with him and he went by himself. During this expedition, he contracted a cold, which lingered and, according to Rusk, strained his heart. Rusk died of [[heart disease]] on February 2, 1931 in [[Grants Pass, Oregon]]. Rusk, about two months prior, requested that some members of the Cascadians take his ashes and place them in a [[cairn]] on The Castle of his beloved [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]]. Clarence Truitt and Clarence Starcher completed this request on July 27, 1931. This small monument remains today.{{sfn|Lloyd|1978}}{{sfn|ObitA|1931}}{{sfn|ObitB|1931}}

==Mountaineering career==
Rusk's [[mountaineering]] career took him all over the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] of the [[United States]], beginning in 1889 and continuing to 1930. He met many other people on his many journeys; however, few people became close friends and learned about his personal life. The few who knew him described him as one of the most expert and daring mountaineers in the [[Western United States|West]]. While Rusk had some close calls and got himself into some hair raising situations, he had very few accidents while climbing and often saved others from extreme danger.{{sfn|Rusk|1978}} He was not braggadocious about his exploits and in fact would only give the most matter-of-fact answers about them. He was known to be tenacious in his exploits, yet tempered by his good sense and consideration for others with him. Rusk was most familiar with [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]], climbing it many times and exploring the area around it extensively.{{sfn|Metcalfe2|1910}}{{sfn|Lloyd|1978}}

===Early expeditions===
Rusk began his mountaineering career in the summer following the completion of his first year of teaching school. He and his uncle W. A. Maxwell ascended [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] via the South Climb. The next year, 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of Adams. This was the first recorded circuit by white women and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone.{{sfn|Beckey|2000}} On this trip, he named Avalanche Valley and [[Rusk Glacier]]; however, the Rusk Glacier name was not official until 1901 when Rusk assisted [[Harry Fielding Reid]] in mapping Adams.{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=11-52}}

One of the novelties of mountaineering in the late 1800s and early 1900s was to burn a large red fire on the summit of the high peaks and so &quot;illuminate&quot; it. In 1891, Rusk and several others attempted to illuminate Adams, but were turned back at the false summit by a storm with [[hurricane force]] winds.{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=53-67}}{{sfn|Rusk|1892}}{{sfn|Rusk|1891}}

In 1895, he joined the party from the [[Mazamas]] mountaineering club for the first [[heliography]] between the peaks of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] which included, from north to south, [[Mount Baker]], [[Mount Rainier]], Mount Adams, [[Mount Hood]], [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]], and [[Diamond Peak (Oregon)|Diamond Peak]]. This endeavor was only partially successful due to smoke and logistical problems and only the parties on Hood and Adams were able to communicate. Also on this expedition, three people from the Mazamas measured the altitude of Adams. Rusk, who had long held that Adams was one of the tallest in the range, was pleased to learn that it was over {{convert|12000|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=68-79}}

Two years later, 1897, Rusk, his mother, and his sister climbed Adams again. Afterwards, they went to the Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, insisted that it should be known as such.{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=68-79}}

===Mapping Mount Adams===
For 14 days in 1901, Rusk assisted [[Harry Fielding Reid]] in mapping Mount Adams. Before they began, they ascended Adams with two others, Nelson B. Brooks and Dr. H. S. Goddard, and then circled the mountain with Rusk leading. As they came around the mountain, Rusk suggested names for several of the glaciers. He wanted to name [[Adams Glacier (Mount Adams)|Adams Glacier]] as Reid Glacier in honor of Reid; however, Reid insisted that it should be named something else because he thought it improper to place his own name on the map that he was making and the Mazamas were trying to name a glacier on [[Mount Hood]] after him. This eventually persuaded Rusk, but years later when he wrote ''Tales'', Rusk repeated his wish that the glacier be known as Reid Glacier. Rusk also recommended that the [[Lyman Glacier (Mount Adams)|Lyman Glacier]] be named as such in honor of [[William Denison Lyman]], who had done some to the first research into Adams. Reid officially named [[Rusk Glacier]] after him.{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=80-104}}{{sfn|Reid|1906}}{{sfn|Reid|1905}}

===1902 Mazamas outing===
The [[Mazamas]] returned to Adams in July 1902 and Rusk joined them with a small group from eastern [[Klickitat County]]. The Mazamas had some logistical problems and were not able to climb the day that Rusk and the rest of his party did. After Rusk’s party reached the summit, one of them, whom he called Mrs. Blank to protect her identity, collapsed. They made use of a human toboggan to get her down the mountain. Two days later, Rusk joined the Mazamas party in their ascent.{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=105-116}}{{sfn|Lyman|1903}}

===Mount Baker climb===
In 1903, after the Rusks had moved to [[Hamilton, Washington|Hamilton]], Rusk and his wife attempted to climb [[Mount Baker]]. They were unsuccessful because poor weather turned them away. Later that same year, Rusk made another attempt with George G. Cantwell and W. A. Alexander. Rusk and Cantwell were successful in making the ascent, which was the seventh ascent of Baker and the first direct up the Boulder Ridge.{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=117-135}}{{sfn|BakerAscents|1907}}

===Gathering of the Mountain Clans===
Rusk participated in a &quot;gathering of the mountain clans&quot; on [[Mount Rainier]] in 1905. Always a leader in the mountains, he went with a scouting party from [[Paradise, Washington|Paradise Park]] around to the west side of Rainier, possibly up [[Kautz Cleaver]], in an attempt to find a route that avoided the notorious rockfall on the normal Gibraltar route. Unsuccessful, the scouting party returned and rejoined the rest of the party for the ascent. Over 200 members from the [[Sierra Club]], [[American Alpine Club]], Mazamas, and the [[Appalachian Mountain Club]] were attempting the climb. Because there were so many attempting the climb, the clubs divided into two parties and climbed on succeeding days. Ninety-eight people completed the ascent including Rusk who volunteered as a leader of one of the groups.{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=136-151}}{{sfn|Metcalfe1|1905}}

===Glacier Peak climb===
Rusk climbed [[Glacier Peak]] in August 1906 with A. L. Cool. They were the third party to climb Glacier Peak and the first to climb the east side.{{sfn|Nelson|1910}} The day before the climb, Rusk named [[Cool Glacier]] after Cool as he was the first person to set foot on it. The day after the climb, while they were exploring the lower slopes of Glacier Peak, Rusk named [[Chocolate Glacier]] after the chocolate colored water the emanated from it. A later mapping error switched the names from what Rusk had intended. With the ascent of Glacier Peak, Rusk became the first person to climb the four peaks of Washington over {{convert|10000|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=152-176}}{{sfn|NoteComment|1907}}

===McKinley expedition===

Cool, Claude Ewing Rusk, Frank H. Rojec, and Joseph Ridley]][[File:MazamasPartyWaveGoodbye.jpg|thumb|Members of the Mazamas McKinley expedition give a final salute to Mount McKinley as they prepare to leave. McKinley is the highest peak in the background.|left]]
In 1910, Rusk led an expedition to [[Mount McKinley]] sponsored by ''[[The Pacific Monthly]]'', ''[[The Oregonian]]'', the ''[[New York Herald]]'', and members of the [[Mazamas]] club. Rusk initiated the expedition when he wrote to [[Charles H. Sholes]] of the Mazamas and asked Sholes to join him in an expedition to the mountain. Sholes was unable to join him, but shouldered the responsibility of organizing the expedition and raising funds for it. Eventually, there were three others who accompanied Rusk on the expedition, A. L. Cool, [[Joseph Ridley]], and [[Frank H. Rojec]]. Cool was a good friend of Rusk’s from the area around [[Lake Chelan]] who was well known as an expert mountaineer and guide. Ridley was a forest ranger on the [[Mount Baker National Forest]] who had done much exploring and mapping in the area around [[Mount Baker]]. Rojec, the photographer for the expedition, worked for the [[Kiser Photography Company]] and was well known for his pictures of Western scenery. Their mission was to establish whether Dr. [[Frederick Cook]] had indeed made it to the summit, as well as to reach the summit themselves.{{sfn|Metcalfe2|1910}} From [[Seattle]], they took the [[United States]] [[revenue cutter]] ''Tahoma'' to [[Cook Inlet]]. From there, they took the [[sternwheeler]] ''Alice'' up the [[Susitna River]] to the mouth of the [[Chulitna River (Susitna River)|Chulitna River]] and then hired a local to guide them up the Chulitna and then two miles up the [[Tokositna River]] where they established a base camp. From there they worked their way to the toe of the [[Ruth Glacier]] and then up the Ruth Glacier toward McKinley. It was terribly difficult work because for each mile they advanced, they were required to travel five miles back and forth to get all their equipment up the glacier. They also had underestimated the amount of food they needed for the expedition so Cool returned to the base camp to wait for the return of their guide with more supplies. Rusk, from information given to him by [[S. P. Beecher]], a member of the Cook expedition, and after some exploration up a tributary glacier opposite [[Mount Church (Alaska)|Mount Church]], quickly became convinced that Cook had not actually climbed McKinley, but instead climbed a much shorter peak about 20 miles from McKinley. Rusk named four peaks at the head of this tributary glacier: [[Mounts Sholes]], [[Mount Mazama (Alaska)|Mazama]], [[Mount Glisan|Glisan]], and [[Mount Lee (Alaska)|Lee]]. Sholes, Glisan, and Lee were named after prominent members of the Mazamas club. From there they proceeded up the Ruth Glacier passing through [[The Great Gorge]] and into the [[Ruth Amphitheater]]. At this point, Rusk no longer had any doubts that Cook had not summited McKinley. As he wrote in his article detailing the expedition, they &quot;realized that it would require perhaps weeks or months in which to explore a route to the summit, we realized how utterly impossible and absurd was the story of this man [Cook], who, carrying a pack, claims to have started from the mouth of the Tokositna on the eighth of September, and to have stood on the highest point of McKinley on the sixteenth of the same month. The man does not live who can perform such a feat!&quot; At this point, their food supplies were too low for them to continue further and they were forced to retreat back down the glacier.{{sfn|RuskA|1910}}{{sfn|RuskB|1910}}{{sfn|RuskC|1911}} There was another expedition led by Professor [[Herschel Clifford Parker]] and [[Belmore Browne]] attempting to summit McKinley at the same time. They also failed to reach the summit due to similar circumstances and later reinforced Rusk’s conclusion by finding the very rock that Cook took his famous picture on.{{sfn|Winchester|1911}} The Mazamas expedition had other problems as well. Sometime while they were on the Ruth Glacier, one of the members attempted to kill Rusk by hitting him with a snowshoe, but could not bring himself to finish the job.{{sfn|Lloyd|1978}}

===Exploration of the East Side of Adams===
Rusk returned to Adams in 1918, making a brief visit to the east side with Joe G. Hill and S. E. Sampson and verified the infeasibility of climbing the whole of Battlement Ridge. The next year he returned. This time he spent 10 days examining various possible routes with an inexperienced climber, J. Howard Green. During this trip, Rusk named the [[Wilson Glacier (Mount Adams)|Wilson Glacier]], Victory Ridge, and Roosevelt Cliff. The Wilson Glacier he named in honor of [[Woodrow Wilson]] for being the [[World War I]] president. He named Victory Ridge in honor of the victory achieved in World War I. Roosevelt Cliff he named in honor of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who had been a champion of [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]]. In another error in [[cartography]], the name was later moved from its intended landform. In ''Tales of a Western Mountaineer'', Rusk describes his original intent as &quot;[j]ust beyond the southernmost ice-fall of Wilson Glacier rises a high abrupt precipice and we agreed that it might as well be christened ‘Roosevelt Cliff.’&quot; This is the ridge that divides the Wilson Glacier in two. Rusk made three exploratory attempts up the east side of Adams. The first was up Victory Ridge. They climbed up the ridge to over {{convert|9000|ft|m}}, but were blocked from further progress by a dangerously narrow section of the ridge. Rusk camped here for the night to test how a climbing party that might have to spend the night on the mountain would fare at that altitude. The next attempt was up the northern arm of the Wilson Glacier. On this attempt, Rusk was able to reach an elevation of about {{convert|10000|ft|m}}, but turned back for fear of [[avalanche]]s and his concern for Green’s safety. As Rusk and Green continued to the north, they passed through the area of Devils Gardens and Rusk named it as such because of the curious [[lava]] formations. The final attempt was up the Lava Ridge. On this attempt, they reached the lower extreme of the summit [[ice cap]] somewhere near {{convert|10500|ft|m}}, but were turned back again by falling rocks that Rusk described as hurtling &quot;down the slope with the speed of a rifle-ball.&quot; Rusk felt that it would be dangerous to continue with his inexperienced companion, but he also felt that a well-equipped, experienced party could easily climb the route.{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=177-195}}

===Mount Stuart climbs===
Rusk first climbed [[Mount Stuart]] in 1920. When he first saw it in 1894, Rusk desired to climb it; however, other matters, including the [[Mount McKinley|McKinley]] expedition, prevented him from climbing it. That same year, 1920, the [[Cascadians]] mountaineering club was formed and with Rusk as a leading member, they decided that a record box should be taken to the summit. Rusk climbed Stuart with Rolfe Morse Whitnall in July and although Whitnall was unable to make the summit, Rusk was successful and placed the record box on the summit. Their success inspired the club to send another party later that year on [[Labor Day]]. This party consisted of Clarence Truitt, Harold Carey, Vern Mason, Joseph R. Vincent, Rolland Whitmore, Wayne E. and Fern Richardson, Rolfe and Alice Whitnall, and Rusk. The whole party made the summit, even though they had some close calls and were forced to [[bivouac shelter|bivouac]] part of the way down the mountain. Rusk climbed Stuart again the next year with Wayne Richardson, Truitt, Rolfe Whitnall, Max Hiscock, and Jimmie Frisque. That year, they climbed earlier in the season, the 29th of May, than any party before and many thought that there was still too much snow to climb at that time in the season. All but Whitnall made the summit. Rusk led another much larger party up Stuart on May 29, 1922.{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=196-230}}

===Conquest of the Great East Side===
[[File:Cascadians Climbing Party east side Mount Adams (Washington).jpg|thumb|Cascadians Climbing Party on the east side of [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Adams]] after the ascent. Left to Right: Richardson, Starcher, Truitt, Williams, Whitmore, Coursen, Rusk]]
In 1921, in addition to climbing [[Mount Stuart]], Rusk and a group from the [[Cascadians]] went on an expedition to [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]]. This expedition had as its primary goal to climb the &quot;Great East Side&quot; of Adams. They made their base camp in Avalanche Valley. Fifteen members of the Cascadians completed a climb up the south side of the mountain. However, the main climb was the ascent up the east side led by Rusk. The rest of those in this group were Edgar E. Coursen, Wayne Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence Starcher. The route was very difficult for the climbing equipment that they had available, which was limited to two Swiss [[ice-axe]]s, five [[alpenstock]]s, rope, and [[hobnailed boot]]s. Their route took them up the [[Rusk Glacier]] to the base of the Battlement Ridge, up onto Battlement Ridge and over The Castle, and finally, through the maze of crevasses on the vast summit [[ice cap]]. The route was very difficult and it took a great amount of time to reach The Castle and required that they [[bivouac shelter|bivouac]] for the night on the west side of The Castle next to the summit ice cap. The route also made it clear that there was to be no easy retreat. The whole party completed the climb. Some climbers who had come up from the south side, who some in the Cascadians party knew, were incredulous and could not believe that they had made the climb from the east side.{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=231-265}}{{sfn|Coursen|1921}}

===Mount Hood climb===
[[Mount Hood]] was one of the first mountains Rusk saw when he and his family came from [[Illinois]]; however, he did not get to climb it until much later, in 1922. This climb he made solo up the Cooper Spur route. Once he got to the top, he spent a long time with the [[fire lookout]], Charles A. Phelps, who regaled him of many his adventures as the lookout. On the way back down, Rusk had one of his few climbing accidents, losing his footing and sliding quickly down the slope for a short distance.{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=266-284}}

===Mount Shasta climbs===
The last major [[Cascade Mountains|Cascade Mountain]] to be conquered by Rusk that he wrote about was [[Mount Shasta]]. He and four members from the [[Cascadians]] made an attempt to climb the peak in 1922. The four from the Cascadians were Wayne and Fern Richardson, Clarence Truitt, and Rolfe Whitnall. They nearly made it to the summit, but were balked by sheets of ice in the last hundred feet or so. The next year Rusk made a solo ascent and this time he was successful. Rusk closed his ''Tales'' by stating &quot;[m]y third of a century of [[mountaineering]] was more than rounded out, and, if this should be my last journey to the ice-bound heights, I could not complain.&quot;{{sfn|Rusk|1978|pp=285-309}}

===Final expeditions===
While Shasta was the last mountaineering adventure that Rusk wrote about, he would continue to climb peaks around his [[Grants Pass, Oregon|Grants Pass]] home including [[Mount Thielsen]]. However, Rusk most desired to return to [[Alaska]] and at last conquer [[Mount McKinley]]. Over the following years, Rusk promoted another expedition, but could not get any financial backing. Eventually, he decided to organize an expedition to [[Mount St. Elias]] instead. Several members of the [[Mazamas]] and [[Cascadians]] initially said they would go along, but all eventually backed out for various reasons. In 1930, Rusk went by himself to climb St. Elias. When he arrived in [[Yakutat, Alaska|Yakutat]], he hired a local native to go with him and they set out. However, the boat they took to reach the head of the bay that is the access point to climb the mountain accidentally dropped them off on an island. Rusk and his companion were trapped for weeks waiting for the return of the boat. This was the last expedition that Rusk would go on because he died in February the next year.{{sfn|Lloyd|1978}}

==Written works==
Rusk was a very good writer, with beautiful flowing [[prose]] and fabulous descriptions that make the reader feel as if they are there with him. His writing has been compared to the English [[mountaineer]]s [[Edward Whymper]] and [[Adolphus Warburton Moore]].{{sfn|Zimmermann|1979}}{{sfn|Meany|1925}} In addition to his book, ''Tales of a Western Mountaineer'', he wrote several articles over the course of his life. &quot;The Fourth of July on Mount Adams&quot; and &quot;Illuminating Mount Adams&quot; describe the illumination attempt of Mount Adams.{{sfn|Rusk|1892}}{{sfn|Rusk|1891}} &quot;On the Trail of Dr. Cook,&quot; published in three parts, is Rusk’s account of the [[Mazamas]] [[Mount McKinley|McKinley]] expedition.{{sfn|RuskA|1910}}{{sfn|RuskB|1910}}{{sfn|RuskC|1911}} &quot;The Snow Peaks of the Cascades&quot; describes the various peaks of the [[Cascade Range]].{{sfn|Rusk|1893}} Rusk’s other book, ''Timberline Campfires'', was never published except for one chapter, &quot;The Wonderful Story of Abe Lincoln,&quot; published in the ''American Alpine Journal'' in 1946. His ''Mount Adams–Towering Sentinel of the Lower Columbia Basin'' promoted creating a national park protecting [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]].{{sfn|Lloyd|1978}}

The '''prehistory of the United States''' comprises the occurrences within regions now part of the [[United States of America]] during the interval of time spanning from the [[formation of the Earth]] to the documentation of local [[history]] in [[written form]]. At the start of the [[Paleozoic era]], what is now [[North America|&quot;North&quot; America]] was actually in the [[Southern hemisphere|southern]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|hemisphere]]. Marine life flourished in the country's many seas, although terrestrial life had not yet evolved. During the latter part of the Paleozoic, seas were largely replaced by [[swamps]] home to [[amphibians]] and early [[reptiles]]. When the continents had assembled into [[Pangaea]] drier conditions prevailed. The [[Synapsids|evolutionary precursors]] to [[mammals]] dominated the country until a mass extinction event ended their reign.

The [[Triassic]], first period of the [[Mesozoic era]] followed. [[Dinosaurs]] evolved and began their rise to dominance, quickly spreading into the United States. Soon Pangaea began to split up and North America began drifting north and westward. During the [[Late Jurassic|latter]] [[Jurassic]], the floodplains of the western states were home to dinosaurs like ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''[[Apatosaurus]]'', and ''[[Stegosaurus]]''. During the [[Cretaceous]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]] expanded until it split North America in half. [[Plesiosaurs]] and [[mosasaurs]] swam in its waters. Later into the period it began to withdraw and the coastal plains of the western states were home to dinosaurs like ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', ''[[Triceratops]]'', and ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. Another mass extinction ended the reign of the dinosaurs.

The [[Cenozoic era]] began afterward. The inland sea of the Cretaceous gradually vanished and mammals were beginning to dominate the land. During the [[Eocene]] the western states were home to small primitive [[camels]] and [[horses]] as well as the carnivorous [[creodonts]]. Soon mammals had entered the oceans and the early [[whale]] ''[[Basilosaurus]]'' swam the coastal waters of the southeast. [[Rhino]]-like [[titanotheres]] dominated [[Oligocene]] South Dakota. From this point on the climate in the United States cooled until the [[Pleistocene]], when [[glacier]]s spread. [[Saber-toothed cat]]s, [[woolly mammoth]]s, [[mastodon]]s, and [[dire wolves]] roamed the land. [[Settlement of the Americas|Humans arrived across a land bridge]] between Siberia and Alaska and may have played a role in hunting these animals into extinction.

==Precambrian==
[[File:Cianobacteris estructura.png|thumb|right|100px|&quot;[[Blue-green alga]]&quot;.]]
The oldest known [[eukaryotes]] lived around 1.4 billion years ago during the [[Precambrian]] near [[Beck Spring, California]]. These were [[photosynthetic]] organisms and produced [[oxygen]] as a byproduct of their [[physiology]]. The Beck Spring eukaryotes and other Precambrian photosynthesizers released the oxygen that now makes the planet's atmosphere breathable.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-eucaryotes-40&quot; /&gt; Precambrian [[Blue-green algae]] remains from this age were preserved between [[Copper Harbor]] and [[Eagle harbor]] on the shoreline of [[Lake Superior]] in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.&lt;ref name=&quot;50states-michigan-157&quot; /&gt; The appearance of the first eukaryotic cells in the fossil record were relatively followed by evidence of complex [[multicellular life]]. Rocks in Nevada dating back to a billion years ago preserve trace fossils left behind by [[worm]]s as they burrowed through the sediment.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-multicellular-40&quot; /&gt; Other complex Precambrian lifeforms were preserved in North Carolina&lt;ref name=&quot;north-carolina-paleoportal-general&quot; /&gt; and Arizona.&lt;ref name=&quot;50states-arizona-93&quot; /&gt;

==Paleozoic==
[[File:Trilobitegrowth.jpg|thumb|right|125px|''[[Elrathia]]''.]]
The Phanerozoic eon began following the Precambrian. The first major unit of time it contained was the Cambrian period of the Paleozoic era.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-cambrian-42&quot; /&gt; At the time, earth's continents were in a very different arrangement and were generally smaller than they are today. The southeastern part of the US was connected to South America and Africa and located in the polar latitudes of the southern hemisphere. The western states were located near the equator.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-continents-42&quot; /&gt;

All known life during the [[Cambrian]] was aquatic so areas of the United States above sea level would have been sterile wastelands.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-terrestrial-44&quot; /&gt; [[Trilobites]] are the most common kind of animal in the Cambrian fossil record.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-otherinverts-43&quot; /&gt; Especially notable are the ''[[Elrathia]]'' of the [[Antelope Springs]] region of Utah.&lt;ref name=&quot;50states-utah-273&quot; /&gt; [[Sponge]]-like [[archaeocyathids]] were common in Nevada.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-otherinverts-43&quot; /&gt; [[Brachiopods]], gastropods, and sponges were also important Cambrian animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-otherinverts-43-44&quot; /&gt; Sea levels around North America dropped at the end of the Cambrian. Ecosystems in shallow water probably devastated.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-boundary-45&quot; /&gt; The Cambrian ended with a [[mass extinction]]. Globally, brachiopods and gastropods lost much of their biodiversity, sponges lost about half of their [[Family (taxonomy)|families]] and almost three quarters of contemporary trilobite families vanished at the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-mass-44&quot; /&gt;

Much of the continent would be submerged when the sea finally rose again.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-boundary-45&quot; /&gt; The most common animal in the [[Ordovician]] fossil record seems to have been brachiopods. Large numbers flourished and were preserved in great detail near [[Cincinnati]] during the [[Middle Ordovician]]. Members of this fauna were preserved in Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-invert-45-46&quot; /&gt; Most known Ordovician trilobites are distinct from their Cambrian forbears as the few taxa surviving the mass extinction diversified once again.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-invert-46&quot; /&gt; During the Middle Ordovician, early armored [[Jawless fish|jawless]] [[fish]] called [[ostracoderms]] left behind fragmentary shards of bone in what is now the [[Rocky Mountains]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-vert-47&quot; /&gt; Late in the Ordovician sea levels dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-level-48&quot; /&gt; Another mass extinction marked the end of the Ordovician. Globally, 25% of families disappeared. Major losses were experienced by brachiopods, fishes, [[echinoids]], [[sponges]] and trilobites. This mass extinction was also most damaging to trilobites, which lost 50% of their families.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-mass-47&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Eurypterus Paleoart.jpg|thumb|left|125px|''[[Eurypterus]]''.]]
During the [[Silurian]], warm, shallow seas covered most of North America. Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan were home to vast [[coral reefs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-level-48&quot; /&gt; The reefs of Indiana in particular are among the most diverse of the period on the entire continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;reefs-abstract-7&quot; /&gt; The southeastern United States were still part of Gondwanaland during the Silurian.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-silurian-48&quot; /&gt; Graptolites still inhabited the waters near the eastern coast of the United States but were not as big a component of the Silurian fauna as they used to be during the Ordovician.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-seas-49&quot; /&gt; As the Silurian progressed the seas covering most of the country would retreat. Only the Michigan and New York areas (then near the [[equator]]) were still inundated. However, these landlocked seas were not being replenished by freshwater and so gradually evaporated, leaving concentrated [[salt]] deposits in those regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-level-48&quot; /&gt;

[[Devonian]] North America once again experience home to seas that teemed with life. In fact Devonian marine life may have been more abundant and diverse than at any other point in the Paleozoic.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-devonian-50&quot; /&gt; [[Glass sponges]] became abundant in western New York during the Devonian.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-invert-50&quot; /&gt; Especially notable are the marine fossils of [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio]], which was home to more than 120 kinds of marine life. The local fishes alone left behind more than 50,000 fossils.&lt;ref name=&quot;50states-ohio-233-234&quot; /&gt; During the Late Devonian the oldest known [[seed]]-bearing plants grew in Pennsylvania. The plants responsible for leaving behind the local fossil seeds may have been [[seed ferns]], plants whose fronds resemble ferns but who reproduce through seeds instead of [[spores]].&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-seed-53&quot; /&gt; [[Gilboa Forest]], among the first in the world, formed in New York around this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;50states-newyork-212&quot; /&gt; The Devonian ended with another mass extinction. Globally, 25% of families were lost. Nearly every family of [[ammonoids]], fishes, and [[amphibians]] became extinct. Most known families of coral and trilobite became extinct. Other taxa to suffer declines in diversity include brachiopods, [[bryozoans]], [[crinoids]], and [[ostracodes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-mass-53&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Crinoïde Carbonifère 8127.jpg|thumb|right|100px|''[[Agaricocrinus]]''.]]
The ensuing [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] has been nicknamed the Age of Crinoids because this group left behind such abundant fossils. Other common lifeforms include their relatives the [[blastoids]].&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-crinoids-54&quot; /&gt; The pinhead-sized [[foraminiferan]] ''[[Endothyra]]'' fed on seafloor detritus and was extremely abundant during the Mississippian. Some limestones in Illinois and Missouri that formed at this time are almost entirely composed of its remains.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-forams-55&quot; /&gt; Few fossils of terrestrial life are known from the Mississippian of North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-land-55&quot; /&gt;

During the ensuing Pennsylvanian, the northward drift of [[Gondwanaland]] finally joined the southeastern United States to North America as [[Pangaea]] began to form. Mountain building raised the [[Ancestral Rockies]] in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. Seawaters left the interior of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-pennsylvanian-56&quot; /&gt; Densely vegetated swamps were widespread.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-coalswamps-56&quot; /&gt; The largest insects in geologic history lived during the Pennsylvanian.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-terrinvert-57&quot; /&gt; Giant salamander-like amphibians left behind footprints near Lawrence, Kansas that would later fossilize.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-terraverts-57&quot; /&gt; Fossil footprints from this time period were also preserved in eastern states like Alabama, Georgia, West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania where Carboniferous fossil footprints are known.&lt;ref name=&quot;dinotracksna-ageamphib-34&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Dimetrodon8DB.jpg|thumb|left|125px|'[[Dimetrodon]]''.]]
The world's continents were joined as Pangaea throughout all of the [[Permian]]. [[Volcanic]] activity occurred on the west coast. Seas were present in the southwest and west coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-permian-58&quot; /&gt; The seas of Texas were home to massive reefs made of spined brachiopods jumbled together.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-marinvert-58&quot; /&gt; Seas that had previously covered Kansas, New Mexico and Texas began drying up and left behind salt deposits. The inner portions of the western United States had a hot dry climate. [[Sand dunes]] were common throughout the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-permian-58&quot; /&gt; The insects of the Permian were common and diverse, but smaller than those of the Pennsylvanian. An example of this bounty were the twenty different orders preserved at a site called Insect Hill near [[Elmo, Kansas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-insects-59&quot; /&gt; Massive amphibians were not rare in the southwestern United States but were unable to stray too far from bodies of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-amphib-59&quot; /&gt; ''[[Seymouria]]'' was a twenty inch long transitional form documenting the origin of reptiles from their amphibian-like forbears from Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;50states-texas-270&quot; /&gt; Reptiles were becoming common during the Permian.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-reptiles-59&quot; /&gt; Texas was also home to the pelycosaurs ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' and ''[[Edaphosaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;50states-texas-270&quot; /&gt; Late in the Permian therapsids became the dominant large-bodied terrestrial vertebrates. These were the precursors of mammals.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-therapsids-60&quot; /&gt;

The Permian ended with the most destructive mass extinction in all of earths history. Globally up to 96% of all species may have disappeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-mass-60&quot; /&gt; [[Rugose coral|Rugose]] and [[tabulate corals]] became extinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-extinctseas-60&quot; /&gt; The [[cryptostome]] and [[trepostome]] [[bryozoans]] also became extinct at this time despite their long history of diversity and abundance earlier in the Paleozoic. Brachiopods suffered greatly and never regained their previous numbers or variety. [[Ammonoids]] lost all but one family. [[Eurypterids]] and trilobites became extinct. Blastoids became extinct. Crinoids lost all but one family. The echinoids just squeaked past; only one genus is known to have survived. Typical survivors were small detritivores and sediments feeders. The worst losses were among filter feeders and carnivores.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-extinctseas-61&quot; /&gt;

==Mesozoic==
[[File:Pangaea continents.svg|thumb|right|150px|Map of [[Pangaea]] with modern continents outlined.]]
The eastern United States was part of [[Pangaea]]'s interior for most of the [[Triassic Period]] of the Mesozoic era. At the time, the area lay close to the equator and was connected to western [[Europe]] and [[Africa]]. The union of all of Earth's continents into a single land mass changed the way the [[atmosphere]] and oceans [[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulated]]. This left what is now the eastern US with a hot climate and pronounced seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-triassicbeginnings-33&quot; /&gt; Much of the country was located at about 30 latitudinal degrees North, where there tends to be high atmospheric pressures and little precipitation. The western United States were largely covered in seawater during the Late Triassic. Mountain building and volcanic activity were ongoing in the same region.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-plates-63&quot; /&gt;

The Triassic saw the Earth's biosphere recovering from the [[end-Permian mass extinction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-triassicbeginnings-33&quot; /&gt; After the Permian mass extinction, ammonoids were one of the first groups of marine invertebrates to become abundant and diverse again.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-triassicbeginnings-33&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-marineinverts-63-64&quot; /&gt; During the Middle Triassic the scleractinian corals typical of modern oceans appeared. During the Triassic, corals were rare in North America. Nevertheless, some were present on the west coast, although these corals did not congregate into reefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-marineinverts-64&quot; /&gt; Ichthyosaurs were one of the most important groups of marine reptiles during the Triassic. Important ichthyosaur fossils of this age were preserved in Nevada.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-ichtyo-65&quot; /&gt;

On land, North America's vegetation included plants like [[conifers]], [[cycads]], [[fern]]s, [[ginkgoes]], and [[horsetails]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-triassicbeginnings-33&quot; /&gt; The Triassic vegetation of the east coast indicated swampy conditions in the local rift valleys. Arizona was home to a great forest that would later leave behind the area's famous petrified wood.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-landplants-64&quot; /&gt; Reptiles first began claiming the ecological dominance of marine, terrestrial and aerial habitats during the Triassic that would earn the Mesozoic the nickname &quot;the Age of Reptiles&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-age-64&quot; /&gt;

The Late Triassic also saw the origin of the dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-dinos-64&quot; /&gt; [[Dinosaurs]] left behind abundant fossils in the [[Four Corners]] region and this area is now known as one of the best sources of Late Triassic dinosaur fossils in the United States. Texas is also good source of dinosaur remains from this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-pangaeastory-87&quot; /&gt; The oldest dinosaur remains in the eastern US are about 225 million years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-eastcoastdist-88-89&quot; /&gt; So, dinosaurs had reached the east coast of the United States not long after they evolved in the first place.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-latetriassicdinos-86&quot; /&gt; [[Fossil footprints]] are the most common kind of early dinosaur fossil in the eastern United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-eastcoastdist-89&quot; /&gt;

As the Triassic ended, Pangaea was breaking up into separate continents again. [[Rift valleys]] formed along the east coast as the North American, European and African plates diverged.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-newark-36&quot; /&gt; This process created rifts down the east coast to Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-plates-63&quot; /&gt; One of these rift valleys was inundated with ocean water and became the young [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Volcanism related to the tectonic processes fracturing Pangaea also left deposits in the eastern US.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-newark-34&quot; /&gt; At the end of the Triassic another mass extinction occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-newark-36&quot; /&gt; Globally, this extinction event wiped out roughly one quarter of families. Conodonts went completely extinct. Ammonoids barely survived. Brachiopods lost much of their former diversity as well. On land, most families of amphibians and reptiles became extinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-mass-66&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Diplodocus carnegii.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''[[Diplodocus carnegii]]''.]]
The eastern coast of the US became warmer and wetter during the Early Jurassic because the newly formed Atlantic Ocean brought it into contact with more humid air.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-newark-36&quot; /&gt; Fossils from spanning from the Late Triassic to [[Early Jurassic]] were preserved in the [[Newark Supergroup]], which is found between the Canadian province Nova Scotia and South Carolina.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-eastcoastdist-87-88&quot; /&gt; Rifting continued in the eastern part of the country during the Early Jurassic as the eastern United States drifted apart from Greenland and Europe. The Pacific Plate forced its way under the North American plate, triggering geologic upheaval, including volcanism, on the west coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-plates-67&quot; /&gt; Ichthyosaurs remained the dominant marine reptiles of the Early Jurassic, but as the Jurassic progressed that title was gradually transferred to the plesiosaurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-marinereptiles-69&quot; /&gt;

The stratigraphic unit known as the Morrison Formation was deposited during the Late Jurassic.&lt;ref name=&quot;foster-road-tripping-3&quot; /&gt; These sediments are now exposed in Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Montana.&lt;ref name=&quot;foster-rainbow-2&quot; /&gt; At the time, this region of the country was home to forests of conifers, ginkgos, and tree ferns. Coal would later form from the remains of these plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-plants-68&quot; /&gt; Local mammals diversified significantly during the Jurassic. The Morrison Formation is the best source of Jurassic mammal fossils in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-mammals-70&quot; /&gt; Local dinosaurs included the [[ornithopod]] ''[[Camptosaurus]]'', the [[sauropods]] ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' and ''[[Diplodocus]]'', and the [[theropod]] ''[[Allosaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bigsky-jurassic-62&quot; /&gt; Unlike many periods of geologic history the Jurassic did not end in a mass extinction. There were, however, lesser extinction events going on at the time, with notable losses occurring among ammonoids and dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-end-70&quot; /&gt;

During the Early Cretaceous the Gulf of Mexico began gradually expanding northward.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-rocks-72&quot; /&gt; On land, the eastern United States during resembled the modern [[Mississippi Delta]]. It was a lowlying plain divided by rivers. A thick coat of vegetation covered the region in plants like [[club mosses]], [[conifers]], [[cycads]], [[fern]]s, [[ginkgoes]], [[horsetails]]. and early [[flowers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-eccoast-44&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Rjpalmer tyrannosaurusrex (white background).jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]''.]]
During the Late Cretaceous the Gulf of Mexico had expanded through North America until reaching Alaska.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-rocks-72&quot; /&gt; Up to half of the continent's modern surface area may have been submerged by this sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-latecretaceousparadise-47&quot; /&gt; This is called the Western Interior Seaway.&lt;ref name=&quot;oceans-oneday-6&quot; /&gt; It covered the majority of states like Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas, and Wyoming.&lt;ref name=&quot;oceans-oneday-5&quot; /&gt; The seafloor was smooth and probably never submerged by more than 600 feet of water. A great diversity of invertebrates flourished both on the bottom and in the water column. Examples include [[ammonites]], [[giant clams]], [[crinoids]], [[rudists]], and [[squid]]. Vertebrate life included [[bony fish]]es, [[mosasaurs]], [[plesiosaurs]], [[shark]]s, and [[turtle]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;oceans-oneday-7&quot; /&gt; Areas now occupied by the plains of the east coast from New Jersey southward as well as the Gulf coast region were covered in seawater during the Cretaceous.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-rocks-71-72&quot; /&gt; Sea levels reached their highest level in all of geologic history during the Cretaceous, although they declined before the period ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-cretaceous-71&quot; /&gt; Scleractinian corals were more diverse during the Cretaceous than they are today. Back then coral reefs formed along the Gulf coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-corals-72&quot; /&gt; Rudist bivalves also constructed reefs in the Gulf coast region.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-mollusks-72-73&quot; /&gt; Another bivalve, Exogyra, was so common its fossils are found in almost every Cretaceous marine deposit.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-mollusks-73&quot; /&gt; During the Cretaceous, the dominant group of living fishes, the teleosts, first achieved ascendency over their holostean forbears.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-teleosts-73&quot; /&gt; The aquatic toothed bird Hesperornis is the only known Cretaceous bird whose remains are found with any frequency in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-birds-74&quot; /&gt;

Near the end of the Cretaceous, the Western Interior Seaway began to withdraw. This regression would end up resulting in both halves of North America reuniting. As the seaway withdrew a coastal plain expanded southward into the northern part of the western interior.&lt;ref name=&quot;bigsky-maastrichtian-77&quot; /&gt; Powerful geologic forces began to fold and distort the rocks of Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming, beginning the processes that would form the Rocky Mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-rockymts-72&quot; /&gt; Rivers flowing across the eastern part of what is now Montana, deposited the sediments now known as the [[Hell Creek Formation]]. At the time, Montana was home to some of the most famous dinosaurs; creatures like ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'', ''[[Triceratops]]'', and ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bigsky-maastrichtian-77&quot; /&gt; Despite the western upheaval, the eastern US had achieved geological stability by the [[Late Cretaceous]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-latecretaceousparadise-47&quot; /&gt; The weather was uniformly warm and rainy throughout the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-latecretaceousparadise-48&quot; /&gt; Flowering plants were now common and fossil of [[broadleaf trees]] and [[shrubs]] were preserved in Late Cretaceous rocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;eastcoast-latecretaceousparadise-48&quot; /&gt;

The Cretaceous ended with another mass extinction. This one was the second most devastating in geologic history. Roughly half of all animal families became extinct. Ammonoids and belemnoids were among the marine invertebrates extinguished. Planktonic foraminiferans barely survived. Two thirds of coral species became extinct. About half of sponge families became extinct. Bivalves, bryozoans, and gastropods also sustained heavy losses. The major Mesozoic marine reptile groups became extinct. On land, the non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs became extinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-mass-75&quot; /&gt; The most popular explanation for the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous is that it resulted from a meteorite impact.

==Cenozoic==
[[File:Patriofelis22DB.jpg|thumb|right|125px|The creodont ''[[Patriofelis]]''.]]
After the Cretaceous, a new era of geologic time began; the [[Cenozoic]] era, which means the era of &quot;recent life&quot;. Traditionally, the first period of the Cenozoic was called the [[Tertiary]],&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-tertiary-77&quot; /&gt; however recent recommendations of the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] discourage its use, with the correspondent time span divided between the earlier [[Paleogene]] and the more recent [[Neogene]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ogg, James G. |author2=Gradstein, F. M |author3=Gradstein, Felix M. |title=A geologic time scale 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|year=2004|isbn=0-521-78142-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geologic turmoil on the west coast was maintained as the [[Pacific Plate]] continued to slide under the [[North American Plate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-plates-77&quot; /&gt; During the early part of the Cenozoic period climates were much warmer than they are today. Latitudes as high as South Dakota had a [[subtropical]] climate until as recently as the end of the [[Oligocene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-level-77&quot; /&gt;

Sea level fell throughout the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-level-77&quot; /&gt; Areas of Cenozoic North America that were covered by seawater tended to be areas near the modern coasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-rocks-78&quot; /&gt; The [[Cannonball Sea]] near [[Minot, North Dakota]] was the last of the North American interior.&lt;ref name=&quot;50states-northdakota-224&quot; /&gt; Cenozoic marine invertebrates are best known from deposits near the coasts and tend to resemble modern forms. [[Solitary corals]] became common, but coral reefs formed only around the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-marineinverts-78&quot; /&gt; [[Sharks]] were common during the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-fishes-78&quot; /&gt; From [[Eocene]] times onward they began increasing in size.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-fishes-79&quot; /&gt;

The beginning of the Cenozoic was also the beginning of the Age of Mammals. The small [[shrew]]-like generalist [[insectivores]] that survived the Late Cretaceous extinction event began diversifying into the mammals that dominate the modern world's terrestrial ecosystems.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-age-79&quot; /&gt; The [[creodonts]], which first appeared in the [[Paleocene]], were among the first mammals to specialize in carnivory.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-carnivores-81&quot; /&gt; The coastal region of the southeastern states, like Alabama&lt;ref name=&quot;50states-alabama-86&quot; /&gt; and Mississippi&lt;ref name=&quot;50states-mississippi-171&quot; /&gt; were covered in seawater and home to the primitive whale ''[[Basilosaurus]]'' during the Eocene. The diversity of mammalian carnivores on land increased from the Eocene to the Miocene.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-carnivores-81&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Megacerops 10.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''[[Brontotherium]]''.]]
Around the same time, [[camels]] were becoming common in North America, although they were just barely bigger than modern [[rabbits]] during the Eocene. Early camels had four toes.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-camels-80&quot; /&gt; During the early part of the Eocene the first primitive [[horses]] also began appearing. Among the earliest was ''[[Eohippus]]'', a small animal with four toes on the front feet and three on the rear.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-horses-79&quot; /&gt; A group of mammals called [[oreodonts]] also appeared during the Eocene.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-oreodonts-80&quot; /&gt; By the Oligocene, camels were the size of [[sheep]] and had only two toes.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-camels-80&quot; /&gt; Gradually over time horses also lost toes, but unlike camels, horses' were reduced to a single digit.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-horses-79&quot; /&gt; By the Oligocene their teeth had adapted to endure abrasion from [[silica]] in their increasingly [[grass]]y diets.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-horses-79&quot; /&gt; Horses gradually became common throughout the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-horses-79&quot; /&gt; Large numbers of oreodonts grazed in the badlands of South Dakota by the middle of the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-oreodonts-80&quot; /&gt;  Oreodonts were vaguely pig like and about the size of modern [[goats]]. Their numbers peaked during the Oligocene.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-oreodonts-80&quot; /&gt; The largest mammals of Oligocene North America were the [[rhinoceros]]-like [[titanotheres]]. One spectacular example was the abundant ''[[Brontotherium]]'' of South Dakota, which could be up to 8 feet tall at the shoulder. Despite their early success, by the end of the epoch the entire group became extinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-titanotheres-80&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) - Mauricio Antón.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Wooly mammoths]].]]
Following the Oligocene temperatures began to decline, and with it warm-weather vegetation was forced southward into lower latitudes.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-level-77&quot; /&gt; By the [[Miocene]] some sharks, which had been increasing in size since the Eocene, were over 60 feet long.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-fishes-79&quot; /&gt; [[Mastodons]] arrived in North America by crossing the [[Bering land bridge]] from the old world during the Miocene as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-proboscideans-81&quot; /&gt; The oreodonts became extinct during the [[Pliocene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-oreodonts-80&quot; /&gt; By the time the Pliocene ended more modern [[Carnivora|carnivores]] like [[wolves]] and [[cat]]s appeared. Notable among the latter group were the [[saber-toothed cat]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-carnivores-81&quot; /&gt; [[Woolly mammoth]]s became abundant across the US during the late Cenozoic.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-proboscideans-81&quot; /&gt; During the late [[Pleistocene]], the large volumes of water were held frozen as part of [[glacier]]s. This caused a drop in sea level, which exposed a land bridge between Asia and Alaska. [[Settlement of the Americas|Humans crossed over this bridge]] and started becoming abundant in North America between 11,000 and 12,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-humans-84&quot; /&gt; Despite withstanding the fluctuating climate and concomitant advance and retreat of glaciers, around 10,000 years ago around 32 genera of large mammals suddenly became extinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-migrations-84-85&quot; /&gt; Horses were locally extirpated during these end-Pleistocene megafauna extinctions.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-horses-79&quot; /&gt; Some paleontologists attribute these extinctions to the arrival of early humans, who over hunted the local large game. Under this model, the disappearance of saber-toothed cats and other contemporary predators would be explained by the loss of their primary source of food. However, this explanation is still controversial.&lt;ref name=&quot;audubon-mammal-85&quot; /&gt;

'''Mulatto''' is a term used to refer to persons born of one [[White people|white parent]] and one [[Black people|black parent]], or to persons born of a mulatto parent or parents. The term today is generally confined to &lt;!--STOP! The next word is correct!--&gt;an historical &lt;!-- &quot;an historical&quot; is correct. Please do not change it. --&gt;context, and English-speakers of mixed white and black ancestry seldom choose to identify themselves as &quot;mulatto&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;White Americans Admixture [http://www.servinghistory.com/topics/white_Americans::sub::Admixture Serving History; &quot;The Ancestry of Brazilian mtDNA Lineages&quot;] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287189/ National Library of Medicine, NIH; &quot;Y-STR diversity and ethnic admixture in White and Mulatto Brazilian population samples&quot;] [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1415-47572006000400004&amp;script=sci_arttext Scielo.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is generally considered archaic, and may be taken as pejorative, especially in the United States, where &quot;multiracial&quot; and &quot;biracial&quot; are preferred.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Those terms, however, may also apply to other racial mixtures.

Residents of Spain, Latin America, the Caribbean, and some countries in Africa freely use the term mulatto, or its cognates in other languages, usually without any suggestion of insult.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAE_DLE_mulato&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Mulato|url=http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=mulato|website=Diccionario de la lengua española|publisher=Real Academia Española|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin America, most mulattos have descended from interracial relationships dating to the slavery period, rather than from recent racial mixing. This is especially true in Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Haiti, Cape Verde, Puerto Rico and Venezuela, which have the highest proportions of persons of mixed race.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Etymology==
[[Image:Retrato de Juan Pareja, by Diego Velázquez.jpg|thumb|''[[Juan de Pareja]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez]], 1650]]

The etymology of the term is usually believed to derive from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''mulato'', which comes from ''mula'' (old [[Galician-Portuguese]], from the [[Latin]] ''mūlus''), meaning [[mule]], the [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring of a [[horse]] and a [[donkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Chambers Dictionary of Etymology |encyclopedia=Robert K. Barnhart |page=684 |publisher=Chambers Harrap Publishers Ltd |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|mulatto|accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&amp;TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=mulato|title=Diccionario de la Lengua Española - Vigésima segunda edición |publisher=Real Academia Española|language=Spanish|accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dictionaries and scholarly works trace the word's origins to the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term ''[[muwallad]]'', which means &quot;a person of mixed ancestry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack D. Forbes|title=Africans and Native Americans: the language of race and the evolution of Red-Black peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6aLAeB5QiHAC|year=1993|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06321-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6aLAeB5QiHAC&amp;pg=PA145 145]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Muwallad'' literally means &quot;born, begotten, produced, generated; brought up&quot;, with the implication of being born and raised among Arabs, but not of Arab blood. ''Muwallad'' is derived from the [[Semitic root|root word]] ''WaLaD'' (Arabic: ولد direct Arabic [[transliteration]]: ''waw, lam, dal''), and [[Varieties of Arabic|colloquial Arabic]] pronunciation can vary greatly. ''Walad'' means, &quot;descendant, offspring, scion; child; son; boy; young animal, young one&quot;.

In [[al-Andalus]], ''Muwallad'' referred to the offspring of non-Arab/Muslim people who adopted the Islamic religion and manners. Specifically, the term was historically applied to the descendants of indigenous Christian Iberians who, after several generations of living among a Muslim majority, adopted their culture and religion. Notable examples of this category include the famous Muslim scholar [[Ibn Hazm]]. According to [[Lisan al-Arab]], one of the earliest Arab dictionaries (c. 13th century AD), applied the term to the children of Non-Muslim (often Christian) slaves, or Non-Muslim children who were captured in a war and were raised by Muslims to follow their religion and culture. Thus, in this context, the term &quot;Muwalad&quot; has a meaning close to &quot;the adopted&quot;. According to the same source, the term does not denote being of mixed-race but rather being of foreign-blood and local culture.

In English, printed usage of ''mulatto'' dates to at least the 16th century. The 1595 work ''Drake's Voyages'' first used the term in the context of intimate unions producing biracial children, with the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defining mulatto here as &quot;one who is the offspring of a European and a Black.&quot; This earliest usage regarded &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; as discrete &quot;species&quot;, with the &quot;mulatto&quot; constituting a third separate &quot;species.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=David S.

These sources specify that ''mulato'' would have been derived directly from ''muwallad'' independently of the related word ''[[muladí]],'' a term that was applied to [[Mozarab|Iberian Christians]] who had [[converted to Islam]] during the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Al-Andalus|governance of Iberia]] in the [[Middle Ages]].

The [[Real Academia Española]] (Spanish Royal Academy) casts doubt on the ''muwallad'' theory. It states, &quot;The term ''mulata'' is documented in our diachronic data bank in 1472 and is used in reference to livestock mules in ''Documentacion medieval de la Corte de Justicia de Ganaderos de Zaragoza,'' whereas ''muladí'' (from ''mullawadí'') does not appear until the 18th century, according to [[Joan Coromines|[Joan] Corominas]]&quot;.{{#tag:ref|Corominas describes his doubts on the theory as follows: &quot;[''Mulato''] does not derive from the Arab ''muwállad'', 'acculturated foreigner' and sometimes 'mulatto' (see {{'}}''Mdí''{{'}}), as Eguílaz would have it, since this word was pronounced 'moo-EL-led' in the Arabic of Spain. In the 19th century, [[Reinhart Dozy]] (''Supplément aux Dictionnaires Arabes'', Vol. II, Leyden, 1881, 841a) rejected this Arabic etymology, indicating the true one, supported by the Arabic ''nagîl,'' 'mulatto', derived from ''nagl'', 'mule'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Corominas, Joan and Pascual, José A.

Scholars such as [[Werner Sollors]] cast doubt on the mule etymology for mulatto. In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialists]] such as [[Edward Long]] and [[Josiah Nott]] began to assert that mulattoes were sterile like mules. They projected this belief back onto the etymology of the word mulatto. Sollers points out that this etymology is anachronistic: &quot;The Mulatto sterility hypothesis that has much to do with the rejection of the term by some writers is only half as old as the word 'Mulatto.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Werner Sollors, ''Neither Black Nor White Yet Both'', Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Namibia]], a current-day population of between 20,000 and 30,000 people, known as [[Baster|Rehoboth Basters]], descend from liaisons between the Cape Colony Dutch and indigenous African women. The name Baster is derived from the Dutch word for &quot;bastard&quot; (or &quot;crossbreed&quot;). While some people consider this term demeaning, the [[Basters]] proudly use the term as an indication of their history.

In [[South Africa]], the term [[Coloured]] (also known as ''Bruinmense'', ''Kleurlinge'' or ''Bruin Afrikaners'' in [[Afrikaans]]) used to refer to individuals who possess some degree of sub-Saharan ancestry, but not enough to be considered black-African under the [[law of South Africa]]. Under Apartheid law there were seven categories of Coloured people: Cape Coloured, Cape Malay, Griqua, Indian, Chinese, or other Asiatic, and Other Coloured - the aim of subdivisions was to enhance the meaning of the larger category of Coloured by making it all encompassing. In contemporary society, however, to redress the unfair privileges of the past Apartheid regime the policy of Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) was adopted to level the economic playing field. BEE policy favored indigenous Black Africans for employment, scholarships, government contracts and loans, whereas before such opportunities were strictly reserved for the White minority. Suddenly, the racial hierarchy of the past were reversed; those who suffered the greatest injustices were put first on the list for advancement. African women were of top priority with African men close behind, next came Coloured women followed by Coloured men. Subsequently, Indian men followed Indian women. Legally and politically speaking, all people of color were classified “black” in the non-racialist terms of anti-Apartheid rhetoric of the Black Consciousness Movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/19854/Palmer_indiana_0093A_13466.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=THROUGH A COLOURED LENS: POST-APARTHEID IDENTITY FORMATION AMONGST COLOUREDS IN KZN|last=Palmer|first=Fileve|date=2015|website=Indiana University Scholar Works|publisher=|access-date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to European ancestry, they may also possess Asian ancestry from immigrants from [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Madagascar]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mauritius]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[China]] and/or [[Saint Helena]]. As an interesting note, because Indians did not fall within the definitions of either European or African but were people of color they were classed as “coloureds.” . Based on the Population Registration Act to classify people, laws were put in place prohibiting mixed marriages.  Therefore, many people that were descendants of the &quot;Asian&quot; category were able to legally intermarry with &quot;mixed-race&quot; people because they shared the same nomenclature.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; There was extensive combining of these diverse heritages in the [[Western Cape]], but in other parts of [[southern Africa]], the coloured usually were descendants of two primary ethnic groups - primarily Africans of various tribes and European colonists, with generations of coloured forming families.

In [[KwaZulu-Natal]], most Coloureds (that were classified as &quot;other coloureds&quot;) had British and [[Zulu people|Zulu]] heritage, while Zimbabwean coloureds were descended from [[Shona people|Shona]] or [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] mixing with British and [[Afrikaner]] settlers. [[Griqua people|Griqua]], on the other hand, are descendants of [[Khoisan]] and Afrikaner [[trekboers]]. The Griqua were subjected to an ambiguity of other creole people within Southern African social order. According to Nurse and Jenkins (1975) the leader of this “mixed” group, Adam Kok I, was a former slave of the Dutch governor who was manumitted and provided land outside Cape Town in the eighteenth century. With territories beyond the Dutch East India Company administration, Kok delivered refuge to deserting soldiers, runaway slaves, and remaining members of various Khoikhoi tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

According to genetic studies, some of those who identify as [[White Brazilian]]s (48.4%) also have some mixed-race ancestry (both Subsaharan African and Amerindian ancestry), not surprising given the multiracial history of this country. Brazilians who identify as ''de raça negra'' or ''de cor preta'', i.e. Brazilians of Black African origin, make up 6.9% of the population; genetic studies show their average total ancestry is still mixed: 40% African, 50% European, and 10% Amerindian, but they likely grew up within visibly black communities.

Such [[autosomal DNA]] studies, which measure total genetic contribution, continue to reveal differences between how individuals identify, which is usually based in family and close community, with genetic ancestry, which may relate to a distant past they know little about. Such DNA studies were conducted of students at a school in the poor periphery of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. It found that the multiracial &quot;pardos&quot; were genetically more than 80% European in ancestry. &quot;The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry&quot;, say the researchers. The test results showed that the proportion of European genetic ancestry was higher than students expected.

Mulattoes account for up to 5% of the nation’s population. In [[Haiti]]an history, such mixed-race people, known as free people of color in colonial times, gained some education and property before the Revolution. In some cases, their white fathers arranged for multiracial sons to be educated in France and join the military, giving them an advance economically. Free people of color gained some social capital and political power before the Revolution, were influential during the Revolution and since then. The people of color have retained their elite position, based on education and social capital, that is apparent in the political, economic and cultural hierarchy in present-day Haiti.

Historians have documented sexual abuse of slave women during the colonial and post-revolutionary slavery times by white men in power: planters, their sons before marriage, overseers, etc., producing multiracial children born into slavery. But, Paul Heinegg has documented that most of the free people of color in the 1790–1810 censuses in the Upper South were descended from unions and marriages during the colonial period in Virginia between white women, who were free or indentured servants, and African or African-American men, servant, slave or free. In the early colonial years, working-class people lived and worked closely together, and slavery was not as much of a racial caste. Slave law had established that children in the colony took the status of their mothers. This meant that multi-racial children born to white women were born free. The colony required them to serve lengthy indentures if the woman was not married, but nonetheless, numerous individuals with African ancestry were born free, and formed more free families. Many of these free people of color became leaders in the African-American community; others continued to marry into the white community.&lt;ref&gt;http://freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1995–2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Schneider, Carl J.

Accessed November 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian F. James Davis,
{{quote|Rapes occurred, and many slave women were forced to submit regularly to white males or suffer harsh consequences. However, slave girls often courted a sexual relationship with the master, or another male in the family, as a way of gaining distinction among the slaves, avoiding field work, and obtaining special jobs and other favored treatment for their mixed children (Reuter, 1970:129). Sexual contacts between the races also included prostitution, adventure, [[concubinage]], and sometimes love. In rare instances, where free blacks were concerned, there was marriage (Bennett, 1962:243–68).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9d9FC-gcWaAC&amp;pg Floyd James Davis, ''Who Is Black?: One Nation's Definition''], pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some wealthy planters, especially widowers or young men before they married, took women slaves as [[concubine]]s, as did Virginia planter [[John Wayles]], after being widowed three times. His daughter Martha Wayles, born to his first wife, married [[Thomas Jefferson]], the future president. Wayles took [[Elizabeth Hemings]], a mixed-race slave, as his concubine. The youngest of their six children, who were all three-quarters white and born into slavery, was Sally Hemings. These children were the half-siblings of Jefferson's wife Martha. [[Sally Hemings]] became the concubine of Jefferson several years after he was widowed. They had six children, who were seven-eighths white and born into slavery. Four survived to adulthood, and Jefferson arranged for their freedom, allowing two to &quot;walk away&quot; from Monticello when they became of age and freeing the youngest two sons in his will. Three of these Hemings children passed into white society as adults, and their children were accepted as white. Eston Hemings moved his family to Wisconsin to reduce risk of being kidnapped, and took the surname Jefferson to reflect his ancestry. His son [[John Wayles Jefferson]] ran a hotel in the 1850s. Accepted as white, he served as a colonel in the Union Army in the Civil War, later becoming a successful cotton broker in Memphis, Tennessee.

Some mixed-race persons in the South became slave owners, and many who were accepted in the society supported the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. For example, [[William Ellison]] owned 60 slaves. Andrew Durnford of New Orleans, which had a large population of [[free people of color]], mostly of French descent and Catholic culture, was listed in the census as owning 77 slaves. In Louisiana [[free people of color]] constituted a third class between white colonists and the mass of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Conlin (2011).

Other multiracial people became [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. For example, [[Mary Ellen Pleasant]] and [[Thomy Lafon]] used their fortunes to support the abolitionist cause. Francis E.

Historically in the [[American South]], the term mulatto was also applied at times to persons with mixed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[African American]] ancestry.&lt;ref name=afch&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpusu6xQq6QC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=afro+cherokee+smallpox#v=onepage&amp;q=afro%20cherokee%20smallpox&amp;f=false |title=Ties that Bind: The Story of an Afro-Cherokee Family in Slavery and Freedom |author=Miles, Tiya |accessdate=2009-10-27 |year=2008 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-25002-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a 1705 [[Virginia]] statute reads as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;And for clearing all manner of doubts which hereafter may happen to arise upon the construction of this act, or any other act, who shall be accounted a mulatto, Be it enacted and declared, and it is hereby enacted and declared, That the child of an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] and the child, grand child, or great grand child, of a [[negro]] shall be deemed, accounted, held and taken to be a mulatto.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=General Assembly of Virginia|authorlink1=Virginia|editor1-last=Hening|editor1-first=William Waller|title=Statutes at Large|date=1823|location=Philadelphia|page=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4i3OAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA252|accessdate=30 September 2014|chapter=4th Anne Ch. IV (October 1705)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In early American history, the term mulatto was also used to refer to persons of Native American and European ancestry. Certain tribes of Indians of the Inocoplo family in [[Texas]] referred to themselves as &quot;mulatto.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bmm38 |title=Mulato Indians |work=The Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=2013-01-07}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At one time, Florida's laws declared that a person from any number of mixed ancestries would be legally defined as a mulatto, including White/Hispanic, Black/Indian, and just about any other mix as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8nvkAIulFIC&amp;pg=PA19 |page=19 |title=The Indians of North Florida: From Carolina to Florida, the Story of the Survival of a Distinct American Indian Community |author1=Sewell, Christopher Scott |author2=Hill, S.

===Contemporary era===
{{Further|Multiracial American}}
Mulatto was used as an official [[United States Census|census]] racial category in the United States until 1930. (In the early 20th century, several southern states had adopted the [[one-drop rule]] as law, and southern Congressmen pressed the US Census Bureau to drop the mulatto category: they wanted all persons to be classified as &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot;.) At that time, the term was primarily applied as a category to persons of mixed African and European descent. During the colonial and early federal period, in the Southern colonies and states, it was sometimes applied persons of any mixed ethnicity, including Native American and European. During the early census years of the [[United States]] beginning in 1790, &quot;mulatto&quot; was applied to persons who were identifiably of mixed [[African-American]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ancestry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racerelations.about.com/od/skillsbuildingresources/g/mulattodef.htm|publisher=About.com|work=Race Rekations|title=Mulatto - An Invisible American Identity|accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsawokett.com/Introduction.html |title=Introduction|publisher=Mitsawokett: A 17th Century Native American Community in Central Delaware}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsawokett.com/Plecker.htm |title=Walter Plecker's Racist Crusade Against Virginia's Native Americans |publisher=Mitsawokett: A 17th Century Native American Settlement in Delaware |accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heite.org/Invis.indians1.html|title=Introduction and statement of historical problem|work=Delaware's Invisible Indians|last=Heite|first=Louise|accessdate=2008-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulatto was also used interchangeably with terms like &quot;[[Turks of South Carolina|Turk]]&quot;, leading to ambiguity when referring to [[North Africa]]ns and [[Middle East]]erners, who were of limited number in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/secret/famous/vansallees.html|publisher=PBS Frontline|last=de Valdes y Cocom|first=Mario|work=The Blurred Racial Lines of Famous Families|title=The Van Salee Family|accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2000 United States Census]], 6,171 Americans self-identified as having mulatto ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/population/socdemo/ancestry/ancestry_q_by_DAC_2000.xls Mulatto ancestry in 2000 U.S census]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, multi-racial people have been allowed to identify as having more than one type of ethnic ancestry.

The term &quot;mulatto&quot; was also used to refer to the children of whites who intermarried with [[South Asian]] [[indentured servant]]s brought to the [[British America]]n colonies by the [[East India Company]]. These were not numerous in the mainland colonies. But a daughter born to a [[South Asian]] father and [[Irish American|Irish]] mother in [[Maryland]] in 1680 was classified as a &quot;mulatto&quot; and sold into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Assisi, Francis C.|title=Indian-American Scholar Susan Koshy Probes Interracial Sex|year=2005|publisher=INDOlink|url=http://www.indolink.com/displayArticleS.php?id=111605054006|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with Virginia in 1662, colonies adopted the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'' in slave law, which said that children in the colony were born into the status of their mother. Thus, children born to slave mothers were born into slavery, regardless of who their fathers were; children born to white mothers were free, even if mixed-race.

'''Timeline of women's legal rights in the United States (other than voting)''' represents '''formal''' legal changes and reforms regarding women's rights in the United States. That includes actual law reforms as well as other formal changes, such as reforms through new interpretations of laws by [[precedent]]s. The right to vote is exempted from the timeline: for that right, see ''[[Timeline of women's suffrage in the United States]]''. The timeline also excludes ideological changes and events within feminism and antifeminism: for that, see ''[[Timeline of feminism in the United States]]''.

* The ''[[Comstock Law]]'' was a federal act passed by the [[United States Congress]] on March 3, 1873, as the Act for the &quot;Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use&quot;. The Act criminalized usage of the [[U.S. Postal Service]] to send any of the following items:&lt;ref name=&quot;Horowitz&quot;&gt;Horowitz, Helen Lefkowitz. Rereading Sex.

* [[sex toy]]s,
* Personal letters alluding to any sexual content or information 
* or any information regarding the above items.

In places like [[Washington D.C.]], where the federal government had direct jurisdiction, the act also made it a misdemeanor, punishable by fine and imprisonment, to sell, give away, or have in possession any &quot;obscene&quot; publication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horowitz&quot; /&gt; Half of the states passed similar anti-obscenity statutes that also banned possession and sale of obscene materials, including contraceptives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beisel&quot;&gt;Beisel, Nicola.

The law was named after its chief proponent, [[Anthony Comstock]]. Due to his own personal enforcement of the law during its early days, Comstock received a commission from the postmaster general to serve as a special agent for the U.S. Postal Services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horowitz&quot; /&gt;

* The [[Cable Act of 1922]] (ch. 411, 42 Stat. 1021, &quot;Married Women’s Independent Nationality Act&quot;) was a [[United States federal law]] that reversed former immigration laws regarding marriage.(It is also known as the Married Women's Citizenship Act or the Women's Citizenship Act). Previously, a woman lost her United States citizenship if she married a foreign man, since she assumed the citizenship of her husband, a law that did not apply to United States citizen men who married foreign women. The law repealed sections 3 and 4 of the [[Expatriation Act of 1907]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=I-Mien|last=Tsiang|title=The question of expatriation in America prior to 1907|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press|year=1942|oclc=719352|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Cable Act of 1922 guaranteed independent female citizenship only to women who were married to an &quot;alien eligible to naturalization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Thus, even after the Cable Act become effective, any woman who married an Asian alien lost her United States citizenship, just as under the previous law. The Cable Act also had other limitations: a woman could keep her United States citizenship after marrying a non-Asian alien if she stayed within the United States. However, if she married a foreigner and lived on foreign soil for two years, she could still lose her right to United States nationality.

* ''[[Goesaert v. Cleary]]'', [[court citation|335 U.S. 464]] (1948), was a [[United States]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case in which the Court upheld a [[Michigan]] law  which prohibited women from being licensed as a bartender in all cities having a population of 50,000 or more, unless their father or husband owned the establishment. Valentine Goesaert, the plaintiff in this case, challenged the law on the ground that it infringed on the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Speaking for the majority, Justice Felix Frankfurter affirmed the judgment of the Detroit, Michigan district court and upheld the constitutionality of the state law. The state argued that since the profession of bartending could potentially lead to moral and social problems for women, it was within the state's power to bar them from working as bartenders. Only when the owner of the bar was a sufficiently close relative to the women bartender could it be guaranteed that such immorality would not be present.

In a unanimous opinion written by [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Justice]] [[John Marshall Harlan II]], [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held the Florida jury selection statute was not discriminatory.

It was signed into law on June 10, 1963, by [[John F. Kennedy]] as part of his [[New Frontier]] Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.eeoc.gov/epa/anniversary/epa-40.htm|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20120626131413/http://archive.eeoc.gov/epa/anniversary/epa-40.html|title=The Equal Pay Act Turns 40|archivedate=June 26, 2012|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In passing the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]], [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] stated that [[sex discrimination]]:&lt;ref name=EEOC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/history/35th/thelaw/epa.html|title=Equal Pay Act of 1963|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* depresses wages and [[living standard]]s for [[employee]]s necessary for their health and efficiency;
* prevents the maximum utilization of the available [[Labor force|labor resource]]s;
* tends to cause labor disputes, thereby burdening, affecting, and obstructing [[commerce]];
* burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; and
* constitutes an unfair method of competition.

The law provides (in part) that:

:No [[employer]] having employees subject to any provisions of this section [section 206 of title 29 of the United States Code] shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs[,] the performance of which requires equal [[skill]], effort, and [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a [[seniority|seniority system]]; (ii) a [[merit system]]; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex [ . . . . ] &lt;ref name=EEOC/&gt; For the first nine years of the EPA, the requirement of equal pay for equal work did not extend to persons employed in an executive, administrative or professional capacity, or as an outside salesperson.  Therefore, the EPA exempted white-collar women from the protection of equal pay for equal work. In 1972, Congress enacted the Educational Amendment of 1972, which amended the FLSA to expand the coverage of the EPA to these employees, by excluding the EPA from the professional workers exemption of the FLSA.
; 1964
* [[Title VII]] of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, codified as Subchapter VI of Chapter 21 of [[title 42 of the United States Code]], prohibits discrimination by covered employers on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin (see {{usc|42|2000e-2}}&lt;ref name = &quot;Finduslaw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 – CRA – Title VII – Equal Employment Opportunities – 42 US Code Chapter 21 |publisher=finduslaw |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Title VII applies to and covers an employer &quot;who has fifteen (15) or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year&quot; as written in the Definitions section under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e 42 U.S.C. §2000e(b)]. Title VII also prohibits discrimination against an individual because of his or her association with another individual of a particular race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, such as by an interracial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parr v. Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Company]]'', 791 F.2d 888 (11th Cir. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; The EEO Title VII has also been supplemented with legislation prohibiting pregnancy, age, and disability discrimination (''See'' [[Pregnancy Discrimination#Pregnancy Discrimination Act|Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978]], [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/age_discrimination_in_employment_act_of_1967_adea_29_u_s_code_chapter_14 |title=Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 |publisher=Finduslaw.com |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]).

In very narrowly defined situations, an employer is permitted to discriminate on the basis of a protected trait where the trait is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise. To prove the [[bona fide occupational qualifications]] defense, an employer must prove three elements: a direct relationship between the protected trait and the ability to perform the duties of the job, the BFOQ relates to the &quot;essence&quot; or &quot;central mission of the employer's business&quot;, and there is no less-restrictive or reasonable alternative (''[[United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|499|187|1991}} 111 S.Ct. 1196). The Bona Fide Occupational Qualification exception is an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination based on protected traits (''[[Dothard v. Rawlinson]]'', {{ussc|433|321|1977}} 97 S.Ct. 2720). An employer or customer's preference for an individual of a particular religion is not sufficient to establish a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (''[[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kamehameha School — Bishop Estate]]'', 990 F.2d 458 (9th Cir. 1993)). There are partial and whole exceptions to Title VII for four types of employers:
* Federal government; (Comment: The proscriptions against employment discrimination under Title VII are now applicable to certain federal government offices under [http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21#17 42 U.S.C.

The case involved a [[Connecticut]] &quot;[[Comstock law]]&quot; that prohibited any person from using &quot;any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception.&quot;  By a vote of 7–2, the Supreme Court invalidated the law on the grounds that it violated the &quot;right to marital privacy&quot;, establishing the basis for the right to privacy with respect to intimate practices. This and other cases view the right to privacy as a right to &quot;protect[ion] from governmental intrusion.&quot;

Although the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] does not explicitly mention &quot;privacy&quot;, Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote for the majority that the right was to be found in the &quot;[[penumbra (law)|penumbras]]&quot; and &quot;emanations&quot; of other constitutional protections, such as the [[self-incrimination clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]] wrote a concurring opinion in which he used the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] in support of the Supreme Court's ruling. Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]] and Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II]] wrote concurring opinions in which they argued that privacy is protected by the [[due process clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Justice [[Byron White]] also wrote a concurrence based on the due process clause.

The Court ruled 7–2 that a right to [[Privacy#Privacy law|privacy]] under the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion, but that this right must be balanced against the state's two legitimate interests in regulating abortions: protecting women's health and protecting the potentiality of human life.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Roe v.

* ''[[Geduldig v.

It held that the denial of [[insurance]] benefits for work loss resulting from a normal [[pregnancy]] did not violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].  The [[California]] insurance program at issue did not exclude workers from eligibility based on [[sex]] but did exclude pregnancy from a list of compensable [[disabilities]].  The majority found that even though only women would be directly affected by the administrative decision, the classification of normal pregnancy as non-compensable was not a sex-based classification, and therefore the court would defer to the state so long as it could provide a [[Rational basis review|rational basis]] for its categorization.

However, on the issue of whether women could fill close contact jobs in all male maximum security prisons the Court ruled 6-3 that the BFOQ defense was legitimate in this case. The reason for this finding is that female prison guards were more vulnerable to male sexual attack than male prison guards.&lt;ref&gt;Cushman, C., 2001, Supreme Court Decisions and Women's Rights.

The Court, 8-1, elaborates on its parental consent decision of 1976. It implies that states may be able to require a pregnant, unmarried minor to obtain parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides an alternative procedure to parental approval, such as letting the minor seek a state judge's approval instead.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(a) Every person who performs or induces an abortion shall prior thereto have made a determination based on his experience, judgment or professional competence that the fetus is not viable, and if the determination is that the fetus is viable or if there is sufficient reason to believe that the fetus may be viable, shall exercise that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus which such person would be required to exercise in order to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born and not aborted and the abortion technique employed shall be that which would provide the best opportunity for the fetus to be aborted alive so long as a different technique would not be necessary in order to preserve the life or health of the mother.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Doctors who failed to adhere to the provisions of this section were liable to civil and criminal prosecution &quot;as would pertain to him had the fetus been a child who was intended to be born and not aborted.&quot; Franklin and others sued, arguing that the provision was both vague and overbroad. In a 6-3 decision written by ''[[Roe v. Wade|Roe]]'' author [[Harry Blackmun]], the Supreme Court agreed, finding that requiring a determination &quot;if... the fetus is viable or if there is sufficient reason to believe the fetus may be viable&quot; was insufficient and impermissibly vague guidance for physicians who might face criminal liability if a jury disagrees with their judgment.
* ''[[Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney]]'', 442 U.S. 256 (1979), was a case heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

Grove City College was not a federally funded institution; however, they did accept students who were receiving [[Basic Educational Opportunity Grant]]s through a Department of Education program.&lt;ref name=&quot;oyez&quot;/&gt; The Department of Education's stance was that, because some of its students were receiving federal grants, the school was receiving federal assistance and Title&amp;nbsp;IX applied to it. The Court decided that since Grove City College was only receiving federal funding through the grant program, only that program had to be in compliance. The ruling was a major victory for those opposed to Title&amp;nbsp;IX, as it made many institutions' sports programs outside of the rule of Title&amp;nbsp;IX and, thus, reduced the scope of Title&amp;nbsp;IX.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suggs&quot;&gt;Suggs, Welsh.

* ''[[Price Waterhouse v.

The Court held that the employer, the accounting firm [[Price Waterhouse]], must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision regarding employment would have been the same if sex discrimination had not occurred. The accounting firm failed to prove that the same decision to postpone [[Ann Hopkins]]'s promotion to partnership would have still been made in the absence of sex discrimination, and therefore, the employment decision constituted sex discrimination under [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The significance of the Supreme Court's ruling was twofold. First, it established that [[Sexism#Gender stereotypes|gender stereotyping]] is actionable as sex discrimination. Second, it established the [[Mixed motive discrimination|mixed-motive framework]] as an evidentiary framework for proving discrimination under a disparate treatment theory even when lawful reasons for the adverse employment action are also present.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Leslie. &quot;Gender Stereotyping and the Workplace: Price Waterhouse v.

* ''[[Jespersen v. Harrah's Operating Co.]]'', No. 03-15045 (9th Cir. Apr. 14, 2006, en banc) was a United States federal [[employment law]] [[sex discrimination]] case.

Darlene Jespersen was a 20-year employee at [[Harrah's Casino]] in [[Reno, Nevada]].  In 2000, Harrah's advanced a &quot;Personal Best&quot; policy, which created strict standards for employee appearance and grooming, which included a requirement that women wear substantial amounts of [[makeup]].  Jespersen was fired for non-compliance with its policy. Jespersen argued the makeup requirement was contrary to her self-image, and that the requirement violated [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VII|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shrm.org/Publications/HRNews/Pages/CMS_016820.aspx|title=9th Circuit: Cosmetics cause of action OK'd|last=Moldover|first=Judith A.|date=April 28, 2006|work=HR Magazine|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selmi|first=Michael|year=2007|title=The Many Faces of Darlene Jespersen|journal=Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy|volume=14|page=467|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/djglp14&amp;div=19&amp;id=&amp;page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Jespersen filed a lawsuit in [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada]], which found against her claim. The district court opined that the policy imposed &quot;equal burdens&quot; on both sexes and that the policy did not discriminate based on [[Suspect classification#Federal classifications|immutable]] characteristics of her sex.  The [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed the decision, but on rehearing [[en banc]], reversed part of its decision.  The full panel concluded, in contrast to the previous rulings, that such grooming requirements could be challenged as sex [[stereotyping]] in some cases, even in view of the decision in ''[[Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins]]''. However, the panel found that Jespersen had not provided evidence that the policy had been motivated by stereotyping, and affirmed the district court's finding for Harrah's.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChandlerJones2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Susan|last2=Jones|first2=Jill B.|title=Casino Women: Courage in Unexpected Places|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uUcalBahjVwC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=14 November 2012|date=2011-07-28|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801450143|pages=79–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Publishers2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Publishers|first=Aspen|title=Employment Law: Keyed to Courses Using Rothstein and Liebman's Employment Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlN6M5MrqTcC&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=14 November 2012|date=2008-05-02|publisher=Aspen Publishers Online|isbn=9780735571860|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CooperMcGinley2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=Frank Rudy|last2=McGinley|first2=Ann C.|title=Multidimensional Masculinities and Law: Feminist and Critical Race Lenses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCbhyu-7ljgC&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=14 November 2012|date=August 2012|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814723500|pages=54–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Obama administration issued a new rule stating that a closely held for-profit company that objects to covering contraception in its health plan can write a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services stating its objection, and that the Department will then notify a third-party insurer of the company's objection, and the insurer will provide birth control coverage to the company's female employees at no additional cost to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=07/10/2015 12:45 pm EDT |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/10/white-house-birth-control_n_7771004.html?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000063 |title=White House Finds Way Around Hobby Lobby Birth Control Decision |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= July 10, 2015|accessdate=2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A policy update in 2015 required all [[Indian Health Services]]-run pharmacies, clinics, and emergency departments to have Plan B One-Step in stock, to distribute it to any woman (or her representative) who asked for it without a prescription, age verification, registration or any other requirement, to provide orientation training to all staff regarding the medication, to provide unbiased and medically accurate information about emergency contraception, and to make someone available at all times to distribute the pill in case the primary staffer objected to providing it on religious or moral grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rankin |first=Kenrya |url=http://www.colorlines.com/articles/policy-gives-native-women-equal-access-emergency-contraception |title=This Policy Gives Native Women Equal Access to Emergency Contraception |publisher=Colorlines |date= |accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Zubik v.

Churches are already exempt under those regulations.&lt;ref name=nyt20160323&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/us/politics/supreme-court-case-on-contraceptives-mandate-may-offer-little-closure.html?_r=0 Justices Seem Split in Case on Birth Control Mandate], Adam Liptak, New York Times, March 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a [[per curiam]] ruling in ''[[Zubik v.

Burwell'', No. 14–1418, 578 U.S. ___, slip op. at 3, 5 (2016) (per curiam).&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Petitioners agreed that &quot;their religious exercise is not infringed where they 'need to do nothing more than contract for a plan that does not include coverage for some or all forms of contraception'&quot;, the Court held that the parties should be given an opportunity to clarify and refine how this approach would work in practice and to &quot;resolve any outstanding issues&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Zubik'', slip op. at 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court expressed &quot;no view on the merits of the cases.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Zubik'', slip op. at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a concurring opinion, Justice Sotomeyer, joined by Justice Ginsburg noted that in earlier cases &quot;some lower courts have ignored those instructions&quot; and cautioned lower courts not to read any signals in the Supreme Court's actions in this case.&lt;ref&gt;''Zubik'', slip op. at 2-3 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Miracle At Philadelphia: The Story of the Constitutional Convention''''' is a work of historical non-fiction, written by [[Catherine Drinker Bowen]] and originally published in 1966. Bowen recounts the [[Philadelphia Convention]], a meeting in 1787 that created the [[United States Constitution]]. Bowen draws much of her information from notes and journals of the Framers, especially [[James Madison]]. It contains vivid description of many founders including [[George Washington]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[James Madison]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], and [[Gouverneur Morris]], important compromises such as the [[Great Compromise]], and controversial issues such as [[slavery]].

'''Anna Maria Lane''' (about 1755-1810) was the first documented female soldier from Virginia to fight with the [[Continental Army]] in the [[American  Revolutionary War]].   She dressed as a man and accompanied her husband on the battlefield, and was later awarded a pension for her courage in the [[Battle of Germantown]].

==Early life==

Little is known about Anna Maria Lane's early life, though it is believed  she may be from [[New Hampshire]].  By 1776, she had married John Lane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edu.lva.virginia.gov/online_classroom/shaping_the_constitution/people/anna_maria_lane Library of Virginia, Shaping the Constitution: Anna Marie Lane]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime service==

[[File:Detail, Battle of Germantown.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Detail of  Painting &quot;Battle of Germantown&quot;]]

Lane and her husband John joined the [[Continental Army]] in 1776, and served initially under [[Israel Putnam|General Israel Putnam]].&lt;ref&gt;T [https://books.google.com/books?id=drE50WEN1WUC&amp;q=Anna+Maria+Lane#v=snippet&amp;q=Anna%20Maria%20Lane&amp;f=false endrich, Lisa Frank, An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields, Volume 1 ABC-CLIO, 2013, p 350-51]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treadway, Sandra Gioia. “Anna Maria Lane: An Uncommon Soldier of the American Revolution.” Virginia Cavalcade 37, no. 3 (1988): 134–143.&lt;/ref&gt; Though some  women accompanied the soldiers  as   [[camp followers]] during the [[American Revolution]] to help out as cooks,  nurses or laundresses, Lane was the only documented woman in [[Virginia]] to dress as a man and fight on the battle field. Historians have speculated that it probably wasn't difficult for Lane to pass as a man, because Revolutionary soldiers didn't bathe very often and slept in their uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Hakim, Joy From Colonies to Country, Volume 3, Oxford University Press, Sep 15, 2002, p 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.org/media/podcasts/053110/WomenSoldiers.cfm Colonial Williamsburg: Women Soldiers]&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;As far as enlistment, there are no physicals when one enters the Army  in the 18th century,&quot; said historian Joyce Henry, &quot;One must have front teeth and an operating thumb and forefinger so one may be able to reach in, grab a cartridge, tear off the paper, and be able to successfully load your musket.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.org/media/podcasts/053110/WomenSoldiers.cfm Colonial Williamsburg: Women Soldiers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lane  and her husband fought in  campaigns in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  On October 3, 1777,  they served under [[George Washington]] in the [[Battle of Germantown]], near [[Philadelphia]], where Anna Marie was severely wounded, which left her lame for life.&lt;ref&gt;-[http://edu.lva.virginia.gov/online_classroom/shaping_the_constitution/people/anna_maria_lane Library of Virginia, Shaping the Constitution: Anna Marie Lane]&lt;/ref&gt;   Just before the Battle of Germantown, George Washington had issued an edict which forbade women &quot;camp followers&quot; from accompanying men to the battlefield, so some historians have suggested that Anna Marie did not want to receive treatment for her wound for fear of being discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.org/media/podcasts/053110/WomenSoldiers.cfm Colonial Williamsburg: Women Soldiers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her injury, Anna Maria continued  fighting  alongside her husband when he re-enlisted in the Virginia Light Dragoons.  She was with him when he was wounded in The [[Siege of Savannah]] in 1779.&lt;ref&gt;An Encyclopedia of American Women at War:Tendrich Frank, Lisa,  From the Home Front to the Battlefields, Volume 1,  ABC-CLIO, 2013, p 350-51&lt;/ref&gt; They both served until 1781.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.org/media/podcasts/053110/WomenSoldiers.cfm Colonial Williamsburg: Women Soldiers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

[[File:Letter from William Cabell.jpg|thumb|Letter from William Cabell about Anna Maria Lane]]

After the war ended in 1783,  the Lanes settled down in Virginia.  John Lane worked for a while at the state arsenal at [[Point of Fork]] in [[Fluvanna County]].  In 1801 the couple moved to [[Richmond, Virginia]]  where he joined the Public Guard. They lived in the barracks of the Public Guard with their three children and received daily rations.&lt;ref&gt;Tendrich Frank, Lisa, An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields, Volume 1   ABC-CLIO, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In Richmond, Anna Maria volunteered to tend to soldiers at the military hospital.  There, she met Dr. John H Foushee, who asked Governor [[James Monroe]] and the Council of State to authorize a small stipend for her nursing work.

Anna Maria Lane had apparently stopped working at the hospital by late 1804,  since her name no longer appeared in the list of nurses in the council journal.   In 1808, after Lane's husband and several other men were discharged from the public guard  for disability, Governor [[William Cabell (American Revolution)|William H Cabell]] asked the General Assembly to give pensions to those disabled male soldiers, as well as a few women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/destiny/where_women/veteran.htm Library of Virginia: Working Out Her Destiny]&lt;/ref&gt; Cabell specifically mentioned Anna Maria Lane, writing   that she was &quot;very infirm, having been disabled by a severe wound which she received while fighting as a common soldier, in one of our Revolutionary battles, from which she never has recovered, and perhaps never will recover.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/destiny/where_women/cabell.htm Library of Virginia: Working Out Her Destiny]&lt;/ref&gt;  Her pension notes that Anna Maria Lane was given $100 a year for life in recognition of the fact that she,  'in the Revolutionary War, performed extraordinary military services at the Battle of Germantown, in the garb, and with the courage of a soldier.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.org/media/podcasts/053110/WomenSoldiers.cfm Colonial Williamsburg: Women Soldiers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Lane died on June 13, 1810. It is not known when her husband John died. She did not become of interest to historians until the editor of the Richmond Magazine discovered her pension records and wrote an article about her in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.org/media/podcasts/053110/WomenSoldiers.cfm Colonial Williamsburg: Women Soldiers]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the Virginia [[Sons of the American Revolution]] honored Anna Marie Lane by sponsoring a descriptive marker in Richmond, VA near the Bell Tower in [[Capitol Square]], erected by the Department of Historic Resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.markerhistory.com/anna-marie-lane-soldier-of-the-american-revolution-marker-sa-47/ Anna Maria Lane: Soldier of the American Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/destiny/where_women/veteran.htm Library of Virginia: Working Out Her Destiny]&lt;/ref&gt;

The date of the start of the '''history of the United States''' is a subject of debate among historians. Older textbooks start with the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|arrival of Christopher Columbus]] on October 12, 1492 and emphasize the European background,  or they start around 1600 and emphasize the American frontier. In recent decades American schools and universities typically have shifted back in time to include more on the colonial period and much more on the prehistory of the [[History of Native Americans in the United States|Native peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Stokes, ed. ''The State of U.S. History'' (2002) pp 1, 348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a capsule online history see Alonzo Hamby, &quot;Outline of U.S. History&quot; (2010) [http://www.america.gov/publications/books/history-outline.html online]; for recent textbooks see  David M. Kennedy and Lizabeth Cohen, '' The American Pageant'' (16th ed. 2016);  James A. Henretta, Rebecca Edwards and Robert O. Self, ''America's History'' (8th ed. 2014);  James L. Roark, et al. ''American Promise'' (5th ed. 2013);  Robert A. Divine, et al. ''America Past and Present'' (10th ed. 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Native Americans in the United States|Indigenous people]] lived in what is now the [[United States]] for thousands of years before [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] began to arrive, mostly from England, after 1600. The Spanish had small settlements in [[Florida]] and the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], and the French along the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]]. By the 1770s, [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen British colonies]] contained two and a half million people along the Atlantic coast east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. In the 1760s, the British government imposed a series of new taxes while rejecting the American argument that any new taxes had to be approved by the people (see [[Stamp Act 1765]]). Tax resistance, especially the [[Boston Tea Party]] (1774), led to punitive laws (the [[Intolerable Acts]]) by Parliament designed to end self-government in Massachusetts. American Patriots (as they called themselves)  adhered to a political ideology called [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] that emphasized civic duty, virtue, and opposition to corruption, fancy luxuries and aristocracy.

Armed conflict began in 1775 as Patriots drove the royal officials out of every colony and assembled in mass meetings and conventions. In 1776, Congress declared that there was a new, independent nation, the United States of America, not just a collection of disparate colonies. With large-scale military and financial support from France and military leadership by General [[George Washington]], the American Patriots won the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].

The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|peace treaty of 1783]] gave the new nation the land east of the Mississippi River (except Florida and Canada). The central government established by the [[Articles of Confederation]] proved ineffectual at providing stability, as it had no authority to collect taxes and had no executive officer. Congress called a [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|convention]] to meet secretly in Philadelphia in 1787.  It wrote [[United States Constitution|a new Constitution]], which was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] was added to guarantee [[inalienable rights]]. With Washington as the first [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] his chief political and financial adviser, a strong central government was created. When [[Thomas Jefferson]] became president he purchased the [[Louisiana Territory]] from France, doubling the size of the United States. A second and final war with Britain was [[War of 1812|fought in 1812]].

Encouraged by the notion of [[Manifest Destiny]], federal territory expanded all the way to the Pacific. The U.S. always was large in terms of area, but its population was small, only 4 million in 1790. [[Demographics of the United States|Population growth was rapid]], reaching 7.2 million in 1810, 32 million in 1860, 76 million in 1900, 132 million in 1940, and 321 million in 2015. Economic growth in terms of overall GDP was even faster. However the nation's military strength was quite limited in peacetime before 1940. The expansion was driven by a quest for inexpensive land for [[yeoman]] farmers and slave owners. The expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was increasingly controversial and fueled political and constitutional battles, which were resolved by compromises. Slavery was abolished in all states [[Northern United States|north]] of the [[Mason–Dixon line]] by 1804, but the [[Southern United States|South]] continued to profit off the institution, producing high-value cotton exports to feed increasing high demand in Europe. The [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]] of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] was on a platform of ending the expansion of slavery and putting it on a path to extinction.

Seven cotton-based deep South slave states seceded and later founded the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] months before [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's inauguration]]. No nation ever recognized the Confederacy, but it opened the war by [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attacking Fort Sumter]] in 1861. A surge of nationalist outrage in the North fueled a long, intense [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865). It was fought largely in the South as the overwhelming material and manpower advantages of the North proved decisive in a long war. The war's result was restoration of the Union, the impoverishment of the South, and the abolition of slavery. In the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]] (1863–1877), legal and voting rights were extended to the [[Freedmen|freed slave]]. The national government emerged much stronger, and because of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]1868, it gained the explicit duty to protect individual rights. However, when white Democrats regained their power in the South during the 1870s, often by paramilitary suppression of voting, they passed [[Jim Crow laws]] to maintain [[white supremacy]], and new [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchising]] constitutions that prevented most [[African American]]s and many poor whites from voting, a situation that continued for decades until gains of the civil rights movement in the 1960s and passage of federal legislation to enforce constitutional rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanessa Holloway 2015&quot;&gt;Vanessa Holloway, ''In Search of Federal Enforcement: The Moral Authority of the Fifteenth Amendment and the Integrity of the Black Ballot, 1870-1965'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States became the world's leading industrial power at the turn of the 20th century due to an outburst of entrepreneurship in the Northeast and Midwest and the arrival of millions of immigrant workers and farmers from Europe. The national railroad network was completed with the work of [[Chinese American|Chinese immigrants]] and large-scale mining and factories industrialized the Northeast and Midwest. Mass dissatisfaction with corruption, inefficiency and traditional politics stimulated the [[Progressive Era|Progressive movement]], from the 1890s to 1920s, which led to many social and political reforms. In 1920, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution guaranteed [[women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] (right to vote). This followed the 16th and 17th amendments in 1913, which established the first national income tax and direct election of US senators to Congress. Initially neutral during [[World War I]], the US [[American entry into World War I|declared war on Germany]] in 1917 and later funded the Allied victory the following year.

After [[Roaring Twenties|a prosperous decade]] in the 1920s, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] marked the onset of the decade-long worldwide [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ended the Republican dominance of the White House and implemented his [[New Deal]] programs for relief, recovery, and reform. The New Deal, which defined [[modern American liberalism]], included relief for the unemployed, support for farmers, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and a [[minimum wage]]. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, the United States later entered [[World War II]] along with [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]], and the smaller number of [[Allies of World War II|Allied nations]]. The U.S. financed the Allied war effort and helped defeat [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theater]] and culminated in using the newly invented [[nuclear weapon]]s [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|on Japanese strategic cities]] that helped defeat [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] at the cost of 407,000 Americans throughout both [[Theater (warfare)|theaters]] of World War II.

The United States and the Soviet Union emerged as rival superpowers after World War II. During the [[Cold War]], the US and the USSR confronted each other indirectly in the [[arms race]], the [[Space Race]], [[proxy war]]s, and propaganda campaigns. [[Foreign policy of the United States|US foreign policy]] during the Cold War was built around the support of [[Western Europe]] and [[Japan]] along with the policy of &quot;containment&quot; or stopping the spread of [[communism]]. The US joined the wars in [[Korean War|Korea]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] to try to stop its spread. In the 1960s, in large part due to the strength of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–68)|civil rights movement]], another wave of social reforms were enacted by enforcing the constitutional rights of voting and freedom of movement to African-Americans and other racial minorities. Native American activism also rose. The Cold War ended when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union officially dissolved]] in 1991, leaving the United States as the world's only superpower. As the 21st century began, international conflict centered around the [[Middle East]] following the [[September 11 attacks]] by [[Al-Qaeda]] on the United States in 2001. In 2008, the United States had its [[United States recession of 2007-2009|worst economic crisis since the Great Depression]], which has been followed by slower than usual rates of economic growth during the 2010s.

It is not definitively known how or when the Native Americans first [[settlement of the Americas|settled the Americas]] and the present-day United States. The prevailing theory proposes that people migrated from [[Eurasia]] across [[Beringia]], a [[land bridge]] that connected [[Siberia]] to present-day [[Alaska]] during the [[Quaternary glaciation|Ice Age]], and then spread southward throughout the Americas and possibly going as far south as the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[Antarctic Peninsula|peninsula]]. This migration may have begun as early as 30,000 years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Ideas About Human Migration From Asia To Americas |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071025160653.htm |work=ScienceDaily |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued through to about 10,000+ years ago, when the land bridge became submerged by the rising sea level caused by the ending of the [[last glacial period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|Cohen|Bailey|2006|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early inhabitants, called [[Paleoamericans]], soon diversified into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes.

The pre-Columbian era incorporates all [[archaeology of the Americas|period subdivisions]] in the [[history of the Americas|history and prehistory of the Americas]] before the appearance of significant European influences on the [[Americas|American]] continents, spanning the time of the [[migration to the New World|original settlement]] in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period to [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] during the [[Early Modern period]]. While technically referring to the era before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyages of 1492 to 1504, in practice the term usually includes the history of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American indigenous cultures]] until they were conquered or significantly influenced by Europeans, even if this happened decades or even centuries after Columbus' initial landing.

Native American cultures are not normally included in characterizations of advanced stone age cultures as &quot;[[Neolithic]],&quot; which is a category that more often includes only the cultures in Eurasia, Africa, and other regions. The [[List of archaeological periods (North America)|archaeological periods]] used are the classifications of archaeological periods and cultures established in [[Gordon Willey]] and [[Philip Phillips (archaeologist)|Philip Phillips]]' 1958&amp;nbsp;book ''Method and Theory in American Archaeology''. They divided the archaeological record in the Americas into five phases;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Gordon R. Willey and Philip Phillips | title=Method and Theory in American Archaeology | publisher= University of Chicago Press| year=1957 | isbn=978-0-226-89888-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Archaeology of the Americas#Archaeological time periods|Archaeology of the Americas]].

The [[Clovis culture]], a [[megafauna]] hunting culture, is primarily identified by use of fluted [[spear]] points. Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The Clovis culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. The culture is identified by the distinctive [[Clovis point]], a flaked flint spear-point with a notched flute, by which it was inserted into a shaft. Dating of Clovis materials has been by association with animal bones and by the use of [[carbon dating]] methods. Recent reexaminations of Clovis materials using improved carbon-dating methods produced results of 11,050 and 10,800 radiocarbon years [[Before Present|B.P.]] (roughly 9100 to 8850&amp;nbsp;BCE).

Numerous [[Paleoindian]] cultures occupied North America, with some arrayed around the [[Great Plains]] and [[Great Lakes]] of the modern [[United States of America]] and [[Canada]], as well as adjacent areas to the West and Southwest. According to the oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, they have been living on this continent since their genesis, described by a wide range of traditional [[creation stories]]. Other tribes have stories that recount migrations across long tracts of land and a great river, believed to be the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref&gt;Deloria, V., Jr., (1997) ''Red Earth White Lies: Native Americans and The Myth of Scientific Fact''.&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic and linguistic data connect the indigenous people of this continent with ancient northeast Asians. Archeological and linguistic data has enabled scholars to discover some of the migrations within the Americas.

[[File:Folsom point.png|thumb|200px|A [[Folsom point]] for a spear.]]
The [[Folsom Tradition]] was characterized by use of [[Folsom point]]s as projectile tips, and activities known from kill sites, where slaughter and butchering of [[bison]] took place. Folsom tools were left behind between 9000&amp;nbsp;BCE and 8000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Hillerman, Anthony G. (1973). &quot;The Hunt for the Lost American&quot;, in ''The Great Taos Bank Robbery and Other Indian Country Affairs'', University of New Mexico Press. ISBN 0-8263-0306-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dené]]-speaking peoples entered North America starting around 8000 BCE, reaching the [[Pacific Northwest]] by 5000 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/670070 D.E.

Retrieved 2010-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt; and from there migrating along the [[Pacific Coast]] and into the interior. Linguists, anthropologists and archeologists believe their ancestors comprised a separate migration into North America, later than the first Paleo-Indians. They migrated into Alaska and northern Canada, south along the Pacific Coast, into the interior of Canada, and south to the Great Plains and the American Southwest.

They were the earliest ancestors of the [[Athabascan]]- speaking peoples, including the present-day and historical [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Apache]]. They constructed large multi-family dwellings in their villages, which were used seasonally. People did not live there year round, but for the summer to hunt and fish, and to gather food supplies for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Leer, Jeff, Doug Hitch, &amp; John Ritter. 2001.

They were part of the [[Southwestern Archaic Traditions|Southwestern Archaic Tradition]] centered in north-central [[New Mexico]], the [[San Juan Basin]], the [[Rio Grande]] Valley, southern [[Colorado]], and southeastern [[Utah]].

Since the 1990s, archeologists have explored and dated eleven Middle [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] sites in present-day Louisiana and Florida at which early cultures built complexes with multiple [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] [[mound]]s; they were societies of hunter-gatherers rather than the settled agriculturalists believed necessary according to the theory of [[Neolithic Revolution]] to sustain such large villages over long periods. The prime example is [[Watson Brake]] in northern Louisiana, whose 11-mound complex is dated to 3500&amp;nbsp;BCE, making it the oldest, dated site in the Americas for such complex construction. It is nearly 2,000&amp;nbsp;years older than the [[Poverty Point]] site. Construction of the mounds went on for 500&amp;nbsp;years until was abandoned about 2800 BCE, probably due to changing environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saunders1&quot;&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/277/5333/1796.full#ref-2 Joe W.

[[Poverty Point culture]] is a Late Archaic [[archaeological culture]] that inhabited the area of the lower Mississippi Valley and surrounding Gulf Coast. The culture thrived from 2200&amp;nbsp;BCE to 700&amp;nbsp;BCE, during the Late Archaic period.&lt;ref&gt;^ Fagan, Brian M. 2005. ''Ancient North America: The Archaeology of a Continent''. Fourth Edition. New York. Thames &amp; Hudson Inc. p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this culture has been found at more than 100&amp;nbsp;sites, from the major complex at [[Poverty Point, Louisiana]] (a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]) across a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} range to the [[Jaketown Site]] near [[Belzoni, Mississippi]].

[[File:Wrangell totem poles.JPG|thumb|200px|Totem poles in [[Wrangell, Alaska]].]]
Poverty Point is a {{convert|1|mi2}} complex of six major earthwork concentric rings, with additional platform mounds at the site. Artifacts show the people traded with other Native Americans located from Georgia to the Great Lakes region. This is one among numerous mound sites of complex indigenous cultures throughout the Mississippi and Ohio valleys. They were one of several succeeding cultures often referred to as [[mound builder (people)|mound builder]]s.

The [[Woodland period]] of [[North America]]n [[pre-Columbian]] cultures refers to the time period from roughly 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE to 1,000&amp;nbsp;CE in the eastern part of North America. The term &quot;Woodland&quot; was coined in the 1930s and refers to prehistoric sites dated between the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] and the [[Mississippian culture]]s. The [[Hopewell tradition]] is the term for the common aspects of the Native American culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern [[United States]] from 200 BCE to 500 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1283 |title=Hopewell |publisher=Ohio History Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] were of many nations and tribal affiliations, each with distinctive cultural and political identities, but they shared certain beliefs, traditions and practices, such as the centrality of [[salmon]] as a resource and spiritual symbol. Their gift-giving feast, [[potlatch]], is a highly complex event where people gather in order to commemorate a special events. These events, such as, the raising of a [[Totem pole]] or the appointment or election of a new chief. The most famous artistic feature of the culture is the Totem pole, with carvings of animals and other characters to commemorate cultural beliefs, legends, and notable events.

The Hopewell tradition was not a single [[culture]] or society, but a widely dispersed set of related populations, who were connected by a common network of trade routes,&lt;ref name=&quot;Price&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Douglas T. Price, and Gary M.

At its greatest extent, the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Southeastern [[United States]] into the southeastern [[Canada|Canadian]] shores of [[Lake Ontario]]. Within this area, societies participated in a high degree of exchange; most activity was conducted along the waterways that served as their major transportation routes. The Hopewell exchange system traded materials from all over the United States.

====Major cultures====
[[File:Grave Creek Mound.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Grave Creek Mound]], located in [[Moundsville, West Virginia]], is one of the largest conical mounds in the [[United States]]. It was built by the [[Adena culture]].]]
*'''[[Adena culture]]''': The Adena culture was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture that existed from 1000 BC to 200 BC, in a time known as the [[Woodland period#Early Woodland period (1000–1 BC)|Early Woodland period]]. The Adena culture refers to what were probably a number of related Native American societies sharing a burial complex and ceremonial system.
[[File:Coles Creek culture map HRoe 2010.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A map showing the extent of the Coles Creek cultural period and some important sites.]]

*'''[[Coles Creek culture]]''': The Coles Creek culture is an indigenous development of the Lower Mississippi Valley that took place between the terminal [[Woodland period]] and the later [[Plaquemine culture]] period.  The period is marked by the increased use of flat-topped [[platform mound]]s arranged around central plazas, more complex political institutions, and a subsistence strategy still grounded in the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]] and hunting rather than on the [[maize]] plant as would happen in the succeeding [[Plaquemine Mississippian]] period. The culture was originally defined by the unique decoration on [[Grog (clay)|grog]]-tempered ceramic ware by [[James A. Ford]] after his investigations at the [[Mazique Archeological Site]]. He had studied both the Mazique and Coles Creek Sites, and almost went with the ''Mazique culture'', but decided on the less historically involved sites name.  It is ancestral to the [[Plaquemine culture]].

[[File:Casagrande2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Great House at the [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument]].]]
*'''[[Hohokam|Hohokam culture]]''': The Hohokam was a culture centered along [[American Southwest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Chenault, Mark, Rick Ahlstrom, and Tom Motsinger, (1993) ''In the Shadow of South Mountain: The Pre-Classic Hohokam of 'La Ciudad de los Hornos','' Part I and II.&lt;/ref&gt; The early Hohokam founded a series of small villages along the middle [[Gila River]]. They raised corn, squash and beans. The communities were located near good arable land, with [[dry farming]] common in the earlier years of this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;mark&quot;/&gt; They were known for their pottery, using the paddle-and-anvil technique. The Classical period of the culture saw the rise in architecture and ceramics. Buildings were grouped into walled compounds, as well as earthen platform mounds. Platform mounds were built along river as well as irrigation canal systems, suggesting these sites were administrative centers allocating water and coordinating canal labor. Polychrome pottery appeared, and inhumation burial replaced cremation. Trade included that of shells and other exotics. Social and climatic factors led to a decline and abandonment of the area after 1400 A.D.

Retrieved 4 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the Ancestral Puebloans developed, at least in part, from the [[Oshara Tradition]], who developed from the [[Picosa culture]]. They lived in a range of structures that included small family pit houses, larger clan type structures, grand [[pueblos]], and cliff sited dwellings. The Ancestral Puebloans possessed a complex network that stretched across the [[Colorado Plateau]] linking hundreds of communities and population centers. The culture is perhaps best known for the stone and earth dwellings built along cliff walls, particularly during the [[Pueblo II Era|Pueblo II]] and [[Pueblo III Era|Pueblo III]] eras. 
**Three [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] located in the United States are credited to the Pueblos: [[Mesa Verde National Park]], [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park]] and [[Taos Pueblo]].

*'''[[Mississippian culture]]''': The Mississippian culture which extended throughout the Ohio and Mississippi valleys and built sites throughout the Southeast, created the largest [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] in North America north of Mexico, most notably at [[Cahokia]], on a tributary of the Mississippi River in present-day Illinois. 
**The ten-story [[Monks Mound]] at Cahokia has a larger circumference than the [[Pyramid of the Sun]] at [[Teotihuacan]] or the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] of [[Egypt]]. The {{convert|6|mi2}} city complex was based on the culture's cosmology; it included more than 100&amp;nbsp;mounds, positioned to support their sophisticated knowledge of [[astronomy]], and built with knowledge of varying soil types. The society began building at this site about 950&amp;nbsp;CE, and reached its peak population in 1,250&amp;nbsp;CE of 20,000–30,000 people, which was not equalled by any city in the present-day United States until after 1800.

Artifacts from the settlement link its major habitation and the construction of the mounds to the Mississippian period, but it was also occupied earlier during the [[Woodland period]].
**The Mississippian culture developed the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]], the name which archeologists have given to the regional stylistic similarity of [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[iconography]], [[ceremony|ceremonies]] and [[mythology]].

**Leadership was restricted to a group of 50 [[sachem]] [[Tribal chief|chief]]s, each representing one [[clan]] within a tribe. The [[Oneida people|Oneida]] and [[Mohawk people]] had nine seats each; the [[Onondaga people|Onondagas]] held fourteen; the [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] had ten seats; and the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] had eight. Representation was not based on population numbers, as the Seneca tribe greatly outnumbered the others. When a sachem chief died, his successor was chosen by the senior woman of his tribe in consultation with other female members of the clan; property and hereditary leadership were passed [[matrilineality|matrilineally]]. Decisions were not made through voting but through consensus decision making, with each sachem chief holding theoretical [[Veto|veto power]]. The Onondaga were the &quot;[[firekeeper]]s&quot;, responsible for raising topics to be discussed.

**Elizabeth Tooker, an [[anthropologist]], has said that it was unlikely the US founding fathers were inspired by the confederacy, as it bears little resemblance to the system of governance adopted in the United States.

**Long-distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples, and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them. The Iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds.

**Through warfare, the Iroquois drove several tribes to migrate west to what became known as their historically traditional lands west of the Mississippi River. Tribes originating in the Ohio Valley who moved west included the [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Kaw people|Kaw]], [[Ponca]] and [[Omaha people]]. By the mid-17th century, they had resettled in their historical lands in present-day [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]].

Native development in [[Hawaii]] begins with the settlement of [[Polynesians]] between [[1st century]] to [[10th century]]. Around 1200 AD [[Tahitians|Tahitian]] explorers found and began settling the area as well. This became the rise of the Hawaiian civilization and would be separated from the rest of the world for another 500 years until the arrival of the British. Europeans under the British explorer [[Captain James Cook]] arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778. Within five years of contact, European military technology would help [[Kamehameha I]] conquer most of the people, and eventually unify the islands for the first time; establishing the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].

After a [[Exploration of North America|period of exploration sponsored by major European nations]], the first successful English settlement was established in 1607. Europeans brought horses, cattle, and hogs to the Americas and, in turn, took back to Europe maize, [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]], potatoes, tobacco, beans, and [[squash (plant)|squash]]. Many explorers and early settlers died after being exposed to new diseases in the Americas. The effects of new Eurasian diseases carried by the colonists, especially smallpox and measles, were much worse for the Native Americans, as they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to them. They [[Native American disease and epidemics|suffered epidemics]] and died in very large numbers, usually before large-scale European settlement began. Their societies were disrupted and hollowed out by the scale of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Joseph Patrick Byrne|title=Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Pvi-ksuKFIC&amp;pg=PA415|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=415–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hinderaker and Rebecca Horn, &quot;Territorial Crossings: Histories and Historiographies of the Early Americas,&quot; ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (2010) 67#3 pp. 395-432 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5309/willmaryquar.67.3.395 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish explorers were the first Europeans  with [[Christopher Columbus]]' [[voyages of Christopher Columbus|second expedition]], to reach [[Puerto Rico]] on November 19, 1493; others reached Florida in 1513.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenberger, ''Juan Ponce de León: the exploration of Florida and the search for the Fountain of Youth'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Spanish expeditions quickly reached the [[Appalachian Mountains]], the [[Mississippi River]], the [[Grand Canyon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pyne|first=Stephen J.|title=How the Canyon Became Grand|place=New York City|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=0-670-88110-4|pages=4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Plains]]. In 1540, [[Hernando de Soto]] undertook an extensive exploration of the Southeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;online&quot;&gt;A. Grove Day, ''Coronado's Quest: The Discovery of the Southwestern States'' (1940) [http://www.questia.com/read/66002285  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1540, [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]] explored from Arizona to central Kansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;online&quot;/&gt; Small Spanish settlements eventually grew to become important cities, such as [[San Antonio, Texas]]; [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]; [[Tucson, Arizona]]; [[Los Angeles, California]]; and [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref&gt;David J. Weber, ''New Spain's Far Northern Frontier: Essays on Spain in the American West, 1540–1821'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Netherland]] was a 17th-century Dutch colony centered on present-day [[New York City]] and the [[Hudson Valley|Hudson River Valley]]; the Dutch traded furs with the Native Americans to the north. The colony served as a barrier to expansion from [[New England]]. Despite being Calvinists and building the [[Reformed Church in America]], the Dutch were tolerant of other religions and cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;questia.com&quot;&gt;Jaap Jacobs, ''The Colony of New Netherland: A Dutch Settlement in Seventeenth-Century America'' (2nd ed. Cornell University Press; 2009) [http://www.questia.com/read/109275503  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The colony, which was taken over by Britain in 1664, left an enduring legacy on  American cultural and political life. This includes secular broad-mindedness and mercantile pragmatism in the city as well as rural traditionalism in the countryside (typified by the story of [[Rip Van Winkle]]). Notable Americans of Dutch descent include [[Martin Van Buren]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and the [[Frelinghuysen (disambiguation)|Frelinghuysen]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;questia.com&quot;/&gt;

[[New France]] was the area [[French colonization of the Americas|colonized by France]] from 1534 to 1763. There were few permanent settlers outside [[Quebec]] and [[Acadia]], but the French had far-reaching trading relationships with Native Americans throughout the Great Lakes and Midwest. French villages along the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Illinois River|Illinois rivers]] were based in farming communities that served as a granary for Gulf Coast settlements. The French established plantations in Louisiana along with settling [[New Orleans]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and [[Biloxi]].

The [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] were military allies of New France through the four French and Indian Wars while the British colonies were allied with the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]. During the [[French and Indian War]]&amp;nbsp;– the North American theater of the [[Seven Years' War]]&amp;nbsp;– New England fought successfully against French Acadia. The British removed [[Acadians]] from [[Acadia]] ([[Nova Scotia]]) and replaced them with [[New England Planters]].&lt;ref&gt;Brebner, John Bartlet. ''New England's Outpost : Acadia before the Conquest of Canada.'' Archon Books Hamden, Conn. 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, some Acadians resettled in Louisiana, where they developed a distinctive rural [[Cajun]] culture that still exists. They became American citizens in 1803 with the [[Louisiana Purchase]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean Jobb, ''The Cajuns: A People's Story of Exile and Triumph'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Other French villages along the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Illinois River|Illinois rivers]] were absorbed when the Americans started arriving after 1770, or settlers moved west to escape them.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Greer, &quot;National, Transnational, and Hypernational Historiographies: New France Meets Early American History,&quot; ''Canadian Historical Review'' (2010) 91#4 pp 695–724&lt;/ref&gt; French influence and language in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] and the Gulf Coast was more enduring; New Orleans was notable for its large population of [[free people of color]] before the Civil War.

The strip of land along the eastern seacoast was settled primarily by English colonists in the 17th century along with much smaller numbers of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Swedish ethnic group|Swedes]]. Colonial America was defined by a severe labor shortage that employed forms of [[unfree labor]] such as [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] and [[indentured servitude]] and by a British policy of benign neglect ([[salutary neglect]]). Over half of all European immigrants to Colonial America arrived as indentured servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html |title=Indentured Servitude in Colonial America |last=Barker |first=Deanna |publisher=National Association for Interpretation, Cultural Interpretation and Living History Section |archiveurl=http://webcitation.org/5klVsFyDj |archivedate=October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salutary neglect permitted the development of an American spirit distinct from that of its European founders.&lt;ref name=&quot;history of colonial&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Henretta |first=James A. |title=History of Colonial America |url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_1741502191___0/History_of_Colonial_America.html |work=Encarta Online Encyclopedia |year=2007 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257013376663041 |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful English colony, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], was established in 1607 on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] in [[Virginia]]. Jamestown languished for decades until a new wave of settlers arrived in the late 17th century and established commercial agriculture based on [[tobacco]]. Between the late 1610s and the Revolution, the British shipped an estimated 50,000 convicts to their American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;James Davie Butler, &quot;British Convicts Shipped to American Colonies,&quot; ''American Historical Review'' (1896) 2#1 pp. 12-33 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1833611 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; A severe instance of conflict was the 1622 [[Powhatan]] uprising in Virginia in which Native Americans killed hundreds of English settlers. The largest conflicts between Native Americans and English settlers in the 17th century were [[King Philip's War]] in [[New England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tougias|first=Michael|title=King Philip's War in New England |url=http://www.historyplace.com/specials/writers/kingphilip.htm |work=HistoryPlace.com|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Yamasee War]] in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Oatis |first= Steven J. |title= A Colonial Complex: South Carolina's Frontiers in the Era of the Yamasee War, 1680–1730 |year= 2004 |publisher= University of Nebraska Press |page= 167}} Online at [https://books.google.com/books?id=_rcFu4KjwVAC Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1622 massacre jamestown de Bry.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Indian massacre of 1622|Indian massacre of Jamestown settlers]] in 1622. Soon the colonists in the South feared all natives as enemies.]]
[[New England]] was initially settled primarily by [[Puritans]]. The [[Pilgrim]]s established a settlement in 1620 at [[Plymouth Colony]], which was followed by the establishment of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1630. The Middle Colonies, consisting of the present-day states of [[History of New York|New York]], [[History of New Jersey|New Jersey]], [[History of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], and [[History of Delaware|Delaware]], were characterized by a large degree of diversity. The first attempted English settlement south of Virginia was the [[Province of Carolina]], with [[Province of Georgia|Georgia Colony]]&amp;nbsp;– the last of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]&amp;nbsp;– established in 1733.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonies were characterized by religious diversity, with many Congregationalists in New England, German and Dutch Reformed in the Middle Colonies, Catholics in Maryland, and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] Presbyterians on the frontier. [[Sephardic Jews]] were among early settlers in cities of New England and the South. Many immigrants arrived as religious refugees: [[French Huguenot]]s settled in New York, Virginia and the Carolinas. Many royal officials and merchants were Anglicans.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the Cope of Heaven: Religion, Society, and Politics in Colonial America'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Religiosity expanded greatly after the [[First Great Awakening]], a religious revival in the 1740s led by preachers such as [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and [[George Whitefield]]. American Evangelicals affected by the Awakening added a new emphasis on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit and conversions that implanted within new believers an intense love for God. Revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and carried the newly created evangelicalism into the early republic, setting the stage for the [[Second Great Awakening]] beginning in the late 1790s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages, evangelicals in the South such as Methodists and Baptists preached for religious freedom and abolition of slavery; they converted many slaves and recognized some as preachers.

Each of the 13 American colonies had a slightly different governmental structure. Typically, a colony was ruled by a governor appointed from London who controlled the executive administration and relied upon a locally elected legislature to vote taxes and make laws. By the 18th century, the American colonies were growing very rapidly as a result of low death rates along with ample supplies of land and food. The colonies were richer than most parts of Britain, and attracted a steady flow of immigrants, especially teenagers who arrived as indentured servants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Max Savelle 2005 185–90&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Max Savelle|title=Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&amp;pg=PA185|origyear=1948|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|pages=185–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tobacco and rice plantations imported African [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] for labor from the British colonies in the West Indies, and by the 1770s African slaves comprised a fifth of the American population. The question of independence from Britain did not arise as long as the colonies needed British military support against the French and Spanish powers. Those threats were gone by 1765. London regarded the American colonies as existing for the benefit of the mother country. This policy is known as [[mercantilism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Max Savelle 2005 185–90&quot;/&gt;

==18th century==
An upper-class, with wealth based on large plantations operated by slave labor, and holding significant political power and even control over the churches, emerged in South Carolina and Virginia.  A unique class system operated in upstate New York, where Dutch tenant farmers rented land from very wealthy Dutch proprietors, such as the Rensselaer family. The other colonies were more equalitarian, with Pennsylvania being representative. By the mid-18th century Pennsylvania was basically a middle-class colony with limited deference to its small upper-class. A writer in the ''Pennsylvania Journal'' in 1756 summed it up:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The People of this Province are generally of the middling Sort, and at present pretty much upon a Level. They are chiefly industrious Farmers, Artificers or Men in Trade; they enjoy in are fond of Freedom, and the ''meanest among them'' thinks he has a right to Civility from the greatest.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Rossiter, ''Seedtime of the Republic: the origin of the American tradition of political liberty'' (1953) p 106.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Political integration and autonomy===
[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|[[Join, or Die]]: This 1756 political cartoon by [[Benjamin Franklin]] urged the colonies to join together during the French and Indian War.]]
The [[French and Indian War]] (1754–63) was a watershed event in the political development of the colonies. It was also part of the larger [[Seven Years' War]]. The influence of the main rivals of the British Crown in the colonies and Canada, the French and North American Indians, was significantly reduced with the territory of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] expanding into [[New France]] both in Canada and the [[Louisiana Territory]]. Moreover, the war effort resulted in greater political integration of the colonies, as reflected in the [[Albany Congress]] and symbolized by [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s call for the colonies to &quot;Join or Die&quot;. Franklin was a man of many inventions&amp;nbsp;– one of which was the concept of a United States of America, which emerged after 1765 and was realized in July 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=H.W. Brands|title=The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLdOMa1MEqsC&amp;pg=PA232|year=2010|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|pages=232–40, 510–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Britain's acquisition of French territory in North America, [[King George III]] issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] with the goal of organizing the new North American empire and protecting the native Indians from colonial expansion into western lands beyond the Appalachian Mountains. In ensuing years, strains developed in the relations between the colonists and the Crown. The [[British Parliament]] passed the [[Stamp Act of 1765]], imposing a tax on the colonies without going through the colonial legislatures. The issue was drawn: did Parliament have this right to tax Americans who were not represented in it? Crying &quot;[[No taxation without representation]]&quot;, the colonists refused to pay the taxes as tensions escalated in the late 1760s and early 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edmund S. Morgan|title=The Birth of the Republic, 1763-89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qr_ruAAACAAJ|origyear=1956|year=2012|edition=4th|publisher=U. of Chicago Press|pages=14–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few people wave their hats from windows in a nearby building.|An 1846 painting of the 1773 [[Boston Tea Party]].]]

The [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773 was a direct action by activists in the town of Boston to protest against the new tax on tea. Parliament quickly responded the next year with the [[Coercive Acts]], stripping Massachusetts of its historic right of self-government and putting it under army rule, which sparked outrage and resistance in all thirteen colonies. Patriot leaders from all 13 colonies convened the [[First Continental Congress]] to coordinate their resistance to the Coercive Acts. The Congress called for a [[Continental Association|boycott of British trade]], published a [[Declaration and Resolves|list of rights and grievances]], and [[Petition to the King (1774)|petitioned the king]] for redress of those grievances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert Allison|title=The Boston Tea Party|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6x7Cmio5hoC|year=2007|publisher=Applewood Books|pages=47–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The appeal to the Crown had no effect, and so the [[Second Continental Congress]] was convened in 1775 to organize the defense of the colonies against the British Army.

Ordinary folk became insurgents against the British even though they were unfamiliar with the ideological rationales being offered. They held very strongly a sense of &quot;rights&quot; that they felt the British were deliberately violating&amp;nbsp;– rights that stressed local autonomy, fair dealing, and government by consent. They were highly sensitive to the issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested in the arrival in Boston of the British Army to punish the Bostonians. This heightened their sense of violated rights, leading to rage and demands for revenge. They had faith that God was on their side.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edward Lender, review of ''American Insurgents, American Patriots: The Revolution of the People'' (2010) by T. H. Breen, in ''The Journal of Military History'' (2012) 76#1 p. 233-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Revolutionary War]] began at Concord and Lexington in April 1775 when the British tried to seize ammunition supplies and arrest the Patriot leaders.

In terms of political values, the Americans were largely united on a concept called [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism]], that rejected aristocracy and emphasized civic duty and a fear of corruption. For the Founding Fathers, according to one team of historians, &quot;republicanism represented more than a particular form of government. It was a way of life, a core ideology, an uncompromising commitment to liberty, and a total rejection of aristocracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Divine, T. H. Breen, et al. ''The American Story'' (3rd ed. 2007)  p 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Revolution==
{{Main article|American Revolution|History of the United States (1776–89)}}
[[File:Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, MMA-NYC, 1851.jpg|thumb|right|[[Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|Washington's surprise crossing of the Delaware River]] in Dec. 1776 was a major comeback after the loss of New York City; his army defeated the British in two battles and recaptured New Jersey.]]

The [[Thirteen Colonies]] began a rebellion against British rule in 1775 and proclaimed their independence in 1776 as the United States of America. In the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83) the American captured the British invasion army at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga in 1777]], secured the Northeast and encouraged the French to make a military alliance with the United States. France brought in Spain and the Netherlands, thus balancing the military and naval forces on each side as Britain had no allies.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Ferling, ''Independence: The Struggle to Set America Free'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[George Washington]] (1732–99) proved an excellent organizer and administrator, who worked successfully with Congress and the state governors, selecting and mentoring his senior officers, supporting and training his troops, and maintaining an idealistic Republican Army. His biggest challenge was logistics,  since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, [[Wiktionary:munitions|munitions]], clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers.

As a battlefield tactician, Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York City and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEH EDSITEMENT&quot;&gt;Lesson Plan on &quot;What Made George Washington a Good Military Leader?&quot; [http://edsitement.neh.gov/curriculum-unit/what-made-george-washington-good-military-leader NEH EDSITEMENT]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Loyalists, whom the British counted upon too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but never were well organized. As the war ended, Washington watched proudly as the final British army quietly sailed out of New York City in November 1783, taking the Loyalist leadership with them. Washington astonished the world when, instead of seizing power for himself, he retired quietly to his farm in Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEH EDSITEMENT&quot;/&gt;  Political scientist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] observes, &quot;The United States was the first major colony successfully to revolt against colonial rule. In this sense, it was the first 'new nation'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, ''The First New Nation'' (1979) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|[[Trumbull's Declaration of Independence]]]]
On July 4, 1776, the [[Second Continental Congress]], meeting in [[Philadelphia]], declared the independence of &quot;the United States of America&quot; in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. July 4 is celebrated as the nation's birthday. The new nation was founded on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals of liberalism in what [[Thomas Jefferson]] called the unalienable rights to &quot;life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&quot;, and dedicated strongly to [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]] principles. Republicanism emphasized the people are sovereign (not hereditary kings), demanded civic duty, feared corruption, and rejected any aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon S. Wood, ''The American Revolution: A History'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confederation and Constitution===
{{further information|Articles of Confederation|History of the United States Constitution}}
In the 1780s the national government was able to settle the issue of the western territories, which were ceded by the states to Congress and became territories. With the migration of settlers to the Northwest, soon they became states. Nationalists worried that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even internal revolts such as the [[Shays' Rebellion]] of 1786 in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jack P. Greene 2004&quot;&gt;Jack P. Greene, and J. R. Pole, eds. ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationalists&amp;nbsp;– most of them war veterans&amp;nbsp;– organized in every state and convinced Congress to call the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787. The delegates from every state wrote a new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] that created a much more powerful and efficient central government, one with a strong president, and powers of taxation. The new government reflected the prevailing republican ideals of guarantees of [[Natural rights|individual liberty]] and of constraining the power of government through a system of [[separation of powers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jack P. Greene 2004&quot;/&gt;

The Congress was given authority to ban the international [[slave trade]] after 20 years (which it did in 1807). A compromise gave the South Congressional apportionment out of proportion to its free population by allowing it to include three-fifths of the number of slaves in each state's total population. This provision increased the political power of southern representatives in Congress, especially as slavery was extended into the Deep South through removal of Native Americans and transportation of slaves by an extensive domestic trade.

To assuage the Anti-Federalists who feared a too-powerful national government, the nation adopted the [[United States Bill of Rights]] in 1791. Comprising the first ten amendments of the Constitution, it guaranteed individual liberties such as freedom of speech and religious practice, jury trials, and stated that citizens and states had reserved rights (which were not specified).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Labunski, ''James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The new Chief Executive===
[[George Washington]]&amp;nbsp;– a renowned hero of the [[American Revolutionary War]], commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]], and president of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]]&amp;nbsp;– became the first President of the United States under the new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in 1789. The national capital moved from New York to Philadelphia and finally settled in Washington DC in 1800.

The major accomplishments of the [[Presidency of George Washington|Washington Administration]] were creating a strong national government that was recognized without question by all Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest McDonald, ''The Presidency of George Washington'' (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; His government, following the vigorous leadership of Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]], assumed the debts of the states (the debt holders received federal bonds), created the [[First Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] to stabilize the financial system, and set up a uniform system of tariffs (taxes on imports) and other taxes to pay off the debt and provide a financial infrastructure. To support his programs Hamilton created a new political party&amp;nbsp;– the first in the world based on voters&amp;nbsp;– the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]].

[[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]] formed an opposition Republican Party (usually called the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] by political scientists). Hamilton and Washington presented the country in 1794 with the [[Jay Treaty]] that reestablished good relations with Britain. The Jeffersonians vehemently protested, and the voters aligned behind one party or the other, thus setting up the [[First Party System]]. Federalists promoted business, financial and commercial interests and wanted more trade with Britain. Republicans accused the Federalists of plans to establish a monarchy, turn the rich into a ruling class, and making the United States a pawn of the British.&lt;ref name=&quot;in JSTOR&quot;/&gt;  The treaty passed, but politics became intensely heated.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Miller, ''The Federalist Era: 1789–1801'' (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in 1794, when western settlers protested against a federal tax on liquor, was the first serious test of the federal government. Washington called out the state militia and personally led an army, as the insurgents melted away and the power of the national government was firmly established.&lt;ref&gt;Lesson Plan on &quot;Washington and the Whiskey Rebellion&quot; [http://edsitement.neh.gov/lesson-plan/washington-and-whiskey-rebellion NEH EDSITEMENT]&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington refused to serve more than two terms&amp;nbsp;– setting a precedent&amp;nbsp;– and in his famous [[George Washington's Farewell Address|farewell address]], he extolled the benefits of federal government and importance of ethics and morality while warning against foreign alliances and the formation of political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=George Washington's Farewell Address |url=http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/milestones/farewell/|work=Archiving Early America|accessdate=June 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Adams]], a Federalist, defeated Jefferson in the 1796 election. War loomed with France and the Federalists used the opportunity to try to silence the Republicans with the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], build up a large army with Hamilton at the head, and prepare for a French invasion. However, the Federalists became divided after Adams sent a successful peace mission to France that ended the [[Quasi-War]] of 1798.&lt;ref name=&quot;in JSTOR&quot;&gt;Marshall Smelser, &quot;The Jacobin Phrenzy: The Menace of Monarchy, Plutocracy, and Anglophilia, 1789-1798,&quot; ''Review of Politics'' (1959) 21#1 pp 239-258 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1405347 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David McCullough, ''John Adams'' (2008) ch 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
{{Main article|Slavery in the United States}}

During the first two decades after the Revolutionary War, there were dramatic changes in the status of slavery among the states and an increase in the number of [[Free negro|freed black]]s. Inspired by revolutionary ideals of the equality of men and influenced by their lesser economic reliance on slavery, northern states abolished slavery.

States of the [[Upper South]] made manumission easier, resulting in an increase in the proportion of [[Free negro|free blacks]] in the Upper South (as a percentage of the total non-white population) from less than one percent in 1792 to more than 10 percent by 1810. By that date, a total of 13.5 percent of all blacks in the United States were free.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery, 1619–1877,'' New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, pp. 79–81&lt;/ref&gt; After that date, with the demand for slaves on the rise because of the Deep South's expanding cotton cultivation, the number of manumissions declined sharply; and an internal U.S. slave trade became an important source of wealth for many planters and traders.

In 1809, president [[James Madison]] severed the U.S.A.'s involvement with the [[Atlantic slave trade]].

==19th century==

===Jeffersonian Republican Era===
[[File:Thomas-Jefferson.jpg|thumb|200px|Jefferson saw himself as a man of the frontier and a scientist; he was keenly interested in expanding and exploring the West.]]
[[File:UnitedStatesExpansion.png|thumb|350px|Territorial expansion; [[Louisiana Purchase]] in white.]]
[[Thomas Jefferson]] defeated Adams for the presidency in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800 election]]. Jefferson's major achievement as president was the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, which provided U.S. settlers with vast potential for expansion west of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon S. Wood, ''Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789–1815'' (2009) pp 368–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson, a scientist himself, supported expeditions to explore and map the new domain, most notably the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Ambrose, ''Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson believed deeply in [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] and argued it should be based on the independent [[yeoman]] farmer and planter; he distrusted cities, factories and banks. He also distrusted the federal government and judges, and tried to weaken the judiciary. However he met his match in [[John Marshall]], a Federalist from Virginia. Although the Constitution specified a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], its functions were vague until Marshall, the Chief Justice (1801–35), defined them, especially the power to overturn acts of Congress or states that violated the Constitution, first enunciated in 1803 in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Edward Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1998) pp 309-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of 1812===
{{Main article|War of 1812}}

Americans were increasingly angry at the British violation of American ships' neutral rights in order to hurt France, the [[impressment]] (seizure) of 10,000 American sailors needed by the Royal Navy to fight Napoleon, and British support for hostile Indians attacking American settlers in the Midwest. They may also have desired to annex all or part of British North America.{{sfn| Stagg| 1983| p=4}}{{sfn|Carlisle|Golson|2007|p=44}}&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Julius W. (1925b.) ''Expansionists of 1812''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Heidler, Jeanne T. Heidler, ''The War of 1812'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of the War of 1812'', Spencer Tucker, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Despite strong opposition from the Northeast, especially from Federalists who did not want to disrupt trade with Britain, Congress declared war in June 18, 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''Empire of Liberty'' (2009) ch 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The war was frustrating for both sides. Both sides tried to invade the other and were repulsed. The American high command remained incompetent until the last year. The American militia proved ineffective because the soldiers were reluctant to leave home and efforts to invade Canada repeatedly failed. The British blockade ruined American commerce, bankrupted the Treasury, and further angered New Englanders, who smuggled supplies to Britain. The Americans under General [[William Henry Harrison]] finally gained naval control of Lake Erie and defeated the Indians under [[Tecumseh]] in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Smelser, &quot;Tecumseh, Harrison, and the War of 1812,&quot; ''Indiana Magazine of History'' (March 1969) 65#1 pp 25-44 [http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu.proxy.cc.uic.edu/iudl/imh/printable/VAA4025-065-1-a02 online]&lt;/ref&gt; while Andrew Jackson ended the Indian threat in the Southeast. The Indian threat to expansion into the Midwest was permanently ended. The British invaded and occupied much of Maine.

The British raided and burned Washington, but were repelled at Baltimore in 1814&amp;nbsp;– where the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|&quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot;]] was written to celebrate the American success. In upstate New York a major British invasion of New York State was turned back. Finally in early 1815 [[Andrew Jackson]] decisively defeated a major British invasion at the [[Battle of New Orleans]], making him the most famous war hero.&lt;ref name=&quot;A. Stagg, 2012&quot;&gt;J. C. A. Stagg, ''The War of 1812: Conflict for a Continent'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

With Napoleon (apparently) gone, the causes of the war had evaporated and both sides agreed to a peace that left the prewar boundaries intact. Americans claimed victory in February 18, 1815 as news came almost simultaneously of Jackson's victory of New Orleans and the [[Treaty of Ghent|peace treaty]] that left the prewar boundaries in place. Americans swelled with pride at success in the &quot;second war of independence&quot;; the naysayers of the antiwar Federalist Party were put to shame and it never recovered. The Indians were the big losers; they never gained the independent nationhood Britain had promised and no longer posed a serious threat as settlers poured into the Midwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;A. Stagg, 2012&quot;/&gt;

===Era of Good Feelings===
{{main article|Era of Good Feelings}}
As strong opponents of the war, the Federalists held the [[Hartford Convention]] in 1814 that hinted at disunion. National euphoria after the victory at New Orleans ruined the prestige of the Federalists and they no longer played a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;James Banner, ''To the Hartford Convention: the Federalists and the Origins of Party Politics in Massachusetts, 1789–1815'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; President Madison and most Republicans realized they were foolish to let the Bank of the United States close down, for its absence greatly hindered the financing of the war. So, with the assistance of foreign bankers, they chartered the [[Second Bank of the United States]] in 1816.&lt;ref name=&quot;George Dangerfield 1812&quot;&gt;George Dangerfield, ''The Era of Good Feellings: America Comes of Age in the Period of Monroe and Adams Between the War of 1812, and the Ascendancy of Jackson'' (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul Goodman 1967&quot;&gt;Paul Goodman, &quot;The First American Party System&quot; in William Nisbet Chambers and Walter Dean Burnham, eds. ''The American Party Systems: Stages of Political Development'' (1967), 56–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republicans also imposed tariffs designed to protect the infant industries that had been created when Britain was blockading the U.S. With the collapse of the Federalists as a party, the adoption of many Federalist principles by the Republicans, and the systematic policy of President [[James Monroe]] in his two terms (1817–25) to downplay partisanship, the nation entered an [[Era of Good Feelings]], with far less partisanship than before (or after), and closed out the [[First Party System]].&lt;ref name=&quot;George Dangerfield 1812&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul Goodman 1967&quot;/&gt;

The [[Monroe Doctrine]], expressed in 1823, proclaimed the United States' opinion that European powers should no longer colonize or interfere in the Americas. This was a defining moment in the [[foreign policy of the United States]]. The Monroe Doctrine was adopted in response to American and British fears over Russian and French expansion into the [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark T. Gilderhus, &quot;The Monroe Doctrine: Meanings and Implications,&quot; ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' March 2006, Vol. 36#1 pp 5–16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832, President [[Andrew Jackson]], 7th President of the United States, ran for a second term under the slogan &quot;Jackson and no bank&quot; and didn't renew the charter of the Second Bank of the United States of America.&lt;ref name=&quot;North Carolina History&quot;/&gt; Jackson was convinced that central banking was used by the elite to take advantage of the average American.&lt;ref name=&quot;North Carolina History&quot;&gt;[http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/769/entry/ Andrew Jackson], North Carolina History Project&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian removal===
{{Main article|Indian removal}}
[[File:Pioneers Crossing the Plains of Nebraska by C.C.A. Christensen.png|thumb|250px|Settlers crossing the [[Great Plains|Plains of Nebraska]].]]

In 1830, Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], which authorized the president to negotiate treaties that exchanged Native American tribal lands in the eastern states for lands west of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;David Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, ''Indian Removal'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal was primarily to remove Native Americans, including the [[Five Civilized Tribes]], from the American Southeast; they occupied land that settlers wanted. [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian Democrats]] demanded the forcible removal of native populations who refused to acknowledge state laws to reservations in the West; Whigs and religious leaders opposed the move as inhumane. Thousands of deaths resulted from the relocations, as seen in the [[Cherokee]] [[Trail of Tears]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Vincent Remini, ''Andrew Jackson and His Indian Wars'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[Seminole Indians]] in Florida refused to move west; they fought the Army for years in the [[Seminole Wars]].

===Second Party System===
{{main article|Second Party System|Presidency of Andrew Jackson}}
After the [[First Party System]] of Federalists and Republicans withered away in the 1820s, the stage was set for the emergence of a new party system based on very well organized local parties that appealed for the votes of (almost) all adult white men.
The former Jeffersonian party split into factions. They split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Monroe]], and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Martin Van Buren]], became the Democratic Party. As Norton explains the transformation in 1828:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first well-organized national party...and tight party organization became the hallmark of nineteenth-century American politics.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p 287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Opposing factions led by [[Henry Clay]] helped form the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. The Democratic Party had a small but decisive advantage over the Whigs until the 1850s, when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery.

Behind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a widely shared political outlook that characterized the Democrats:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 &quot;corrupt bargain&quot; had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics....Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual--the artisan and the ordinary farmer--by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (2007) pp 287-88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Allen Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (U. of Missouri Press, 1995) ch 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Second Great Awakening===
{{main article|Second Great Awakening}}

[[File:Camp meeting.jpg|thumb|300px|A drawing of a Protestant camp meeting, 1829.]]
The Second Great Awakening was a Protestant revival movement that affected the entire nation during the early 19th century and led to rapid church growth. The movement began around 1790, gained momentum by 1800, and, after 1820 membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations, whose preachers led the movement. It was past its peak by the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney  Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People'' (1972) pp 415-71&lt;/ref&gt;

It enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations. Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new [[Millennialism|millennial age]]. The Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements&amp;nbsp;– including [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] and [[Temperance movement|temperance]] designed to remove the evils of society before the anticipated [[Second Coming]] of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy L. Smith, ''Revivalism and Social Reform: American Protestantism on the Eve of the Civil War'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolitionism===
{{main article|Abolitionism in the United States}}
After 1840 the growing abolitionist movement redefined itself  as a crusade against the sin of slave ownership. It mobilized support (especially among religious women in the Northeast affected by the [[Second Great Awakening]]). [[William Lloyd Garrison]] published the most influential of the many anti-slavery newspapers, ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', while [[Frederick Douglass]], an ex-slave, began writing for that newspaper around 1840 and started his own abolitionist newspaper ''[[North Star (newspaper)|North Star]]'' in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;John Stauffer, ''Giants: The Parallel Lives of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  The great majority of anti-slavery activists, such as Abraham Lincoln, rejected Garrison's theology and held that slavery was an unfortunate social evil, not a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James Oakes|title=The Radical and the Republican: Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, and the Triumph of Antislavery Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK0ThVhgcbAC&amp;pg=PA57|year=2008|publisher=W. W.

===Westward expansion and Manifest Destiny===
{{main article|American frontier}}
The American colonies and the new nation grew very rapidly in population and area, as pioneers pushed the frontier of settlement west.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent overview see Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher, ''Frontiers: A Short History of the American West'' (2008); for elaborate detail see  Howard R. Lamar, ed. ''The New Encyclopedia of the American West'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  The process finally ended around 1890–1912 as the last major farmlands and ranch lands were settled. Native American tribes in some places resisted militarily, but they were overwhelmed by settlers and the army and after 1830 were relocated to reservations in the west. The highly influential &quot;[[Frontier Thesis]]&quot; argues that the frontier shaped the national character, with its boldness, violence, innovation, [[individualism]], and democracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert V 2000 p. 10&quot;&gt;Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher, ''The American West: A New Interpretive History'' (Yale University Press, 2000)  p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent historians have emphasized the multicultural nature of the frontier. Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the &quot;Wild West&quot; of the second half of the 19th century. As defined by Hine and Faragher, &quot;frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states&quot;. They explain, &quot;It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert V 2000 p. 10&quot;/&gt;

Through wars and treaties, establishment of law and order, building farms, ranches, and towns, marking trails and digging mines, and pulling in great migrations of foreigners, the United States expanded from coast to coast fulfilling the dreams of [[Manifest Destiny]]. As the American frontier passed into history, the myths of the west in fiction and film took firm hold in the imagination of Americans and foreigners alike. America is exceptional in choosing its iconic self-image. &quot;No other nation,&quot; says David Murdoch, &quot;has taken a time and place from its past and produced a construct of the imagination equal to America's creation of the West.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Murdoch, ''The American West: The Invention of a Myth'' (2001) page vii&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 1830s to 1869, the [[Oregon Trail]] and its many offshoots were used by over 300,000 settlers. '49ers (in the [[California Gold Rush]]), ranchers, farmers, and entrepreneurs and their families headed to California, Oregon, and other points in the far west. Wagon-trains took five or six months on foot; after 1869, the trip took 6 days by rail.&lt;ref&gt;John David Unruh, ''[[The Plains Across (book)|The Plains Across: The Overland Emigrants and the Trans-Mississippi West, 1840–1860]]'' (1993) p 120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mexico nebel.jpg|thumb|250px|The American occupation of [[Mexico City]] during the [[Mexican–American War]].]]
Manifest Destiny was the belief that American settlers were destined to expand across the continent. This concept was born out of &quot;A sense of mission to redeem the Old World by high example ... generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Merk|1963|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manifest Destiny was rejected by modernizers, especially the Whigs like Henry Clay and Abraham Lincoln  who wanted to build cities and factories&amp;nbsp;– not more farms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Walker Howe|Howe]] argues that, &quot;American imperialism did not represent an American consensus; it provoked bitter dissent within the national polity.&quot; Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815–1848'' (2007) pp 705–06&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] strongly favored expansion, and they won the key election of 1844. After a bitter debate in Congress the [[Texas Annexation|Republic of Texas was annexed]] in 1845, which Mexico had warned meant war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faragher, 2000&quot;&gt;Hine and Faragher, ''The American West'' (2000) ch 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

War broke out in 1846, with the homefront polarized as Whigs opposed and Democrats supported the war. The [[U.S. army]], using regulars and large numbers of volunteers, won the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–48). The 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] made peace. Mexico recognized the annexation of Texas and ceded its claims in the Southwest (especially California and New Mexico).&lt;ref name=&quot;Faragher, 2000&quot;/&gt;

The Hispanic residents were given full citizenship and the [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Mexican Indian]]s became [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]s. Simultaneously gold was discovered, pulling over 100,000 men to northern California in a matter of months in the [[California Gold Rush]]. Not only did the then president [[James K. Polk]] expand America's border to the [[Republic of Texas]] and a [[Southwestern United States|fraction of Mexico]] but he also annexed the north western frontier known as the [[Oregon Country]], which was renamed the [[Oregon Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Faragher, 2000&quot;/&gt;

===Divisions between North and South===
{{Main article|Origins of the American Civil War|American Civil War}}

[[File:US Secession map 1863 (BlankMap derived).png|thumb|350px|'''[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] states:''' navy blue (free) and yellow (slave[also known as [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border states]]])&lt;br /&gt;'''[[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] states:''' brown (slave)&lt;br /&gt;'''[[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]]:''' lighter shades of blue and brown]]
The central issue after 1848 was the expansion of slavery, pitting the anti-slavery elements that were a majority in the North, against the pro-slavery elements that overwhelmingly dominated the white South. A small number of very active Northerners were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who declared that ownership of slaves was a sin (in terms of Protestant theology) and demanded its immediate abolition. Much larger numbers were against the expansion of slavery, seeking to put it on the path to extinction so that America would be committed to free land (as in low-cost farms owned and cultivated by a family), free labor (no slaves), and free speech (as opposed to censorship rampant in the South). Southern whites insisted that slavery was of economic, social, and cultural benefit to all whites (and even to the slaves themselves), and denounced all anti-slavery spokesmen as &quot;abolitionists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Forret, ''Slavery in the United States'' (Facts on File, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious activists split on slavery, with the Methodists and Baptists dividing into northern and southern denominations. In the North, the Methodists, Congregationalists, and Quakers included many abolitionists, especially among women activists. (The Catholic, Episcopal and Lutheran denominations largely ignored the slavery issue.)&lt;ref&gt;Jon Sensbach. Review of McKivigan, John R.; Snay, Mitchell, eds., ''Religion and the Antebellum Debate Over Slavery'' H-SHEAR, H-Net Reviews. January 2000. [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=3744 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of slavery in the new territories was seemingly settled by the [[Compromise of 1850]], brokered by Whig [[Henry Clay]] and Democrat [[Stephen Douglas]]; the Compromise included the admission of California as a [[free state (United States)|free state]]. The point of contention was the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], which increased federal enforcement and required even free states to cooperate in turning over fugitive slaves to their owners. Abolitionists pounced on the Act to attack slavery, as in the best-selling anti-slavery [[novel]] ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergus M. Bordewich, ''America's Great Debate: Henry Clay, Stephen A. Douglas, and the Compromise That Preserved the Union'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Compromise of 1820]] was repealed in 1854 with the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], promoted by Senator Douglas in the name of &quot;[[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]]&quot; and democracy. It permitted voters to decide on slavery in each territory, and allowed Douglas to say he was neutral on the slavery issue. Anti-slavery forces rose in anger and alarm, forming the new [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Pro- and anti- contingents rushed to Kansas to vote slavery up or down, resulting in a miniature civil war called [[Bleeding Kansas]]. By the late 1850s, the young Republican Party dominated nearly all northern states and thus the electoral college. It insisted that slavery would never be allowed to expand (and thus would slowly die out).&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Etcheson, ''Bleeding Kansas: Contested Liberty in the Civil War Era'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southern slavery-based societies had become wealthy based on their [[cotton]] and other agricultural [[commodity]] production, and some particularly profited from the internal slave trade. Northern cities such as Boston and New York, and regional industries, were tied economically to slavery by banking, shipping, and manufacturing, including [[textile mills]]. By 1860, there were four million slaves in [[Southern United States|the South]], nearly eight times as many as there were nationwide in 1790. The [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] were highly profitable, because of the heavy European demand for raw cotton. Most of the profits were invested in new lands and in purchasing more slaves (largely drawn from the declining [[tobacco]] regions).

For 50 of the nation's first 72 years, a slaveholder served as President of the United States and, during that period, only slaveholding presidents were re-elected to second terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/social_issues/jan-june07/divided_01-25.html &quot;Interview: James Oliver Horton: Exhibit Reveals History of Slavery in New York City&quot;], ''PBS Newshour'', January 25, 2007, Retrieved February 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, southern states benefited by their increased apportionment in Congress due to the partial counting of slaves in their populations.

Slave rebellions were planned or actually took place&amp;nbsp;– including by [[Gabriel Prosser]] (1800), [[Denmark Vesey]] (1822), [[Nat Turner]] (1831), and [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|John Brown]] (1859)&amp;nbsp;– but they only involved dozens of people and all failed. They caused fear in the white South, which imposed tighter slave oversight and reduced the rights of [[free people of color|free blacks]]. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting to recover escaped slaves, which outraged Northerners. Formerly, an escaped slave, having reached a non-slave state, was presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom. The Supreme Court's 1857 decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional; angry Republicans said this decision threatened to make slavery a national institution.

After [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 presidential election|1860 election]], seven Southern states [[Secession|seceded]] from the union and set up a new nation, the [[Confederate States of America]] (C.S.A.), on February 8, 1861. It attacked [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. Army fort in South Carolina, thus igniting the war. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the Confederacy in April 1861, four more states seceded and joined the Confederacy. A few of the (northernmost) &quot;[[slave and free states|slave states]]&quot; did not secede and became known as the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]; these were Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri.

During the war, the northwestern portion of Virginia seceded from the C.S.A. and became the new Union state of [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; West Virginia is usually grouped with the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]].

===Civil War===
{{Main article|American Civil War}}
[[File:Advantages.jpg|thumb|left|280px|The Union had large advantages in men and resources at the start of the war. The ratio grew steadily in favor of the Union.]]
The Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation]] at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. In response to the attack, on April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and &quot;preserve the Union&quot;, which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. The two armies had their first major clash at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], ending in a Union defeat, but, more importantly, proved to both the Union and Confederacy that the war would be much longer and bloodier than originally anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;Allen C. Guelzo, ''Fateful Lightning: A New History of the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2012) ch 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|upright|Lincoln with [[Allan Pinkerton]] and Major General [[John Alexander McClernand]] at the [[Battle of Antietam]].]]
The war soon divided into two theaters: [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern]] and [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western]]. In the western theater, the Union was quite successful, with major battles, such as [[Battle of Perryville|Perryville]] and [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], producing strategic Union victories and destroying major Confederate operations.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Woodworth, ''Decision in the Heartland: The Civil War in the West'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fire on Lexington Avenue - New York Draft Riot of 1863.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Irish anger at the draft led to the [[New York Draft Riots]] of 1863, one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.]]
Warfare in the Eastern theater started poorly for the Union as the Confederates won at Manassas Junction (Bull Run), just outside Washington. Major General [[George B. McClellan]] was put in charge of the Union armies. After reorganizing the new [[Army of the Potomac]], McClellan failed to capture the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]] in his [[Peninsula Campaign]] and [[Seven Days Battle|retreated after attacks]] from newly appointed Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Catton, ''The Army of the Potomac: Mr. Lincoln's Army'' (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeling confident in his army after defeating the Union at [[Second Bull Run]], Lee embarked on an [[Maryland Campaign|invasion of the north]] that was stopped by McClellan at the bloody [[Battle of Antietam]]. Despite this, McClellan was relieved from command for refusing to pursue Lee's crippled army. The next commander, General [[Ambrose Burnside]], suffered a humiliating defeat by Lee's smaller army at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] late in 1862, causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863, while losing his top aide, [[Stonewall Jackson]]. But Lee pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause [[war-weariness]] in the North. In perhaps the [[turning point of the American Civil War|turning point of the war]], Lee's army was badly beaten at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], July 1–3, 1863, and barely made it back to Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;On Lee's strategy in 1863 see James M. McPherson, &quot;To Conquer a Peace?&quot; ''Civil War Times'' (March/April 2007) 46#2 pp 26-33, online at EBSCO

Simultaneously on July 4, 1863, Union forces under the command of General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gained control of the Mississippi River at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]], thereby splitting the Confederacy. Lincoln made General Grant commander of all Union armies.

The last two years of the war were bloody for both sides, with Grant launching a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against General Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. This war of attrition was divided into three main campaigns. The first of these, the [[Overland Campaign]] forced Lee to retreat into the city of Petersburg where Grant launched his second major offensive, the [[Richmond-Petersburg Campaign]] in which he [[Siege of Petersburg|besieged Petersburg]]. After a near ten-month siege, Petersburg surrendered. However, the [[Third Battle of Petersburg|defense of Fort Gregg]] allowed Lee to move his army out of Petersburg. Grant pursued and launched the final, [[Appomattox Campaign]] which resulted in Lee surrendering his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]]. Other Confederate armies followed suit and the war ended with no postwar insurgency.

Based on [[United States Census, 1860|1860 census]] figures, about 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% from the North and 18% from the South,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Maris Vinovskis|title=Toward a Social History of the American Civil War: Exploratory Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9D4TAwc93VoC|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge U.P. |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing the American Civil War as the deadliest war in American history. Its legacy includes ending slavery in the United States, restoring the Union, and strengthening the role of the federal government.

===Emancipation===
{{See also|Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War|Emancipation Proclamation}}
The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was an executive order issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from &quot;slave&quot; to &quot;free.&quot; It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. The owners were never compensated. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Allen C. Guelzo, ''Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation: The End of Slavery in America'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers moved into camps run by the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], where they were given food, shelter, medical care, and arrangements for their employment were made.

The severe dislocations of war and Reconstruction had a large  negative impact on the black population, with a large amount of sickness and death.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Downs, ''Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction Era===

{{See also|History of the United States (1865–1918)}}

[[File:FreedmenVotingInNewOrleans1867.jpeg|thumb|300px|[[Freedman|Freedmen]] voting in New Orleans, 1867.]]
Reconstruction lasted from Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of January 1, 1863 to the [[Compromise of 1877]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen C. Guelzo, ''Fateful Lightning: A New History of the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2012) pp 445-513 is a brief treatment; see also  Eric Foner, ''A Short History of Reconstruction'' (1990); and Mark Wahlgren Summers, ''The Ordeal of the Reunion: A New History of Reconstruction'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The major issues faced by Lincoln were the status of the ex-slaves (called &quot;Freedmen&quot;), the loyalty and civil rights of ex-rebels, the status of the 11 ex-Confederate states, the powers of the federal government needed to prevent a future civil war, and the question of whether Congress or the President would make the major decisions.

The severe threats of starvation and displacement of the unemployed Freedmen were met by the first major federal relief agency, the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], operated by the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A, Cimbala, ''The Freedmen's Bureau: Reconstructing the American South after the Civil War'' (2005) includes a brief history and primary documents&lt;/ref&gt;

Three &quot;[[Reconstruction Amendments]]&quot; were passed to expand civil rights for black Americans: the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]  outlawed slavery; the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] guaranteed equal rights for all and citizenship for blacks; the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] prevented race from being used to disfranchise men.

Ex-Confederates remained in control of most Southern states for over two years, but that changed when the [[Radical Republicans]] gained control of Congress in the 1866 elections. President [[Andrew Johnson]], who sought easy terms for reunions with ex-rebels, was virtually powerless; he escaped by one vote removal through impeachment. Congress enfranchised black men and temporarily stripped many ex-Confederate leaders of the right to hold office. New Republican governments came to power based on a coalition of Freedmen made up of [[Carpetbaggers]] (new arrivals from the North), and [[Scalawags]] (native white Southerners). They were backed by the US Army. Opponents said they were corrupt and violated the rights of whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;George C. Rable 2007&quot;&gt;George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

State by state they lost power to a conservative-Democratic coalition, which gained control of the entire South by 1877. In response to Radical Reconstruction, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) emerged in 1867 as a white-supremacist organization opposed to black civil rights and Republican rule. President Ulysses Grant's vigorous enforcement of the [[Ku Klux Klan Act]] of 1870 shut down the Klan, and it disbanded. [[Paramilitary]]  groups, such as the [[White League]] and [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] emerged about 1874 that worked openly to use intimidation and violence to suppress black voting to regain white political power in states across the South during the 1870s. Rable described them as the military arm of the Democratic Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;George C. Rable 2007&quot;/&gt;

Reconstruction ended after the disputed [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876 election]]. The [[Compromise of 1877]]  gave Republican candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] the White House. The federal government withdrew its troops from the South, and Southern Democrats took control of every Southern state. .&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Ayers, ''The Promise of the New South: Life After Reconstruction'' (1992) pp 3-54&lt;/ref&gt; From 1890 to 1908, southern states effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most black voters and many poor whites by making voter registration more difficult through [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], [[literacy test]]s, and other arbitrary devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanessa Holloway 2015&quot;/&gt; They passed segregation laws and imposed second-class status on blacks in a system known as [[Jim Crow Laws|Jim Crow]] that lasted until the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–68)|successes of the Civil Rights movement in 1964-65]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Vann Woodward, ''The Strange Career of Jim Crow'' (3rd ed. 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Sitkoff, ''The Struggle for Black Equality'' (3rd ed. 2008) ch 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeply religious Southerners saw the hand of God in history, which demonstrated His wrath at their sinfulness, or His rewards for their suffering. Historian Wilson Fallin has examined the sermons of white and black Baptist preachers after the War. Southern white  preachers said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;God had chastised them and given them a special mission&amp;nbsp;– to maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and traditional race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson Fallin Jr.,  ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007) pp 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The West and the Gilded Age===
[[File:East and West Shaking hands at the laying of last rail Union Pacific Railroad - Restoration.jpg|thumb|300px|The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad (1869) at [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], by Andrew J. Russell.]]
{{main article|Gilded Age}}
The latter half of the nineteenth century was marked by the rapid development and settlement of the far West, first by wagon trains and riverboats and then aided by the completion of the [[transcontinental railroad]]. Large numbers of European immigrants (especially from Germany and Scandinavia) took up low-cost or free farms in the Prairie States. Mining for silver and copper opened up the Mountain West. The United States Army fought frequent small-scale wars with Native Americans as settlers encroached on their traditional lands. Gradually the US purchased the Native American tribal lands and extinguished their claims, forcing most tribes onto subsidized [[Indian reservation|reservations]]. According to the [[U.S. Bureau of the Census]] (1894), from 1789 to 1894:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[American Indian Wars|Indian wars]] under the government of the United States have been more than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians. The actual number of killed and wounded Indians must be very much higher than the given... Fifty percent additional would be a safe estimate...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bureau of the Census|title=Report on Indians taxed and Indians not taxed in the United States (except Alaska)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWkUAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA637|year=1894|page=637}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The &quot;Gilded Age&quot; was a term that [[Mark Twain]] used to describe the period of the late 19th century when there had been a dramatic expansion of American wealth and prosperity. Reform of the Age included the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act|Civil Service Act]], which mandated a competitive examination for applicants for government jobs. Other important legislation included the [[Interstate Commerce Act]], which ended railroads' discrimination against small shippers, and the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], which outlawed monopolies in business. Twain believed that this age was corrupted by such elements as land speculators, scandalous politics, and unethical business practices.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Trachtenberg, ''The Incorporation of America: Culture and Society in the Gilded Age'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the days of [[Charles A. Beard]] and [[Matthew Josephson]], some historians have argued that the United States was effectively [[plutocratic]] for at least part of the [[Gilded Age]] and [[Progressive Era]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles, A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, ''The rise of American civilization'' (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Josephson, ''The robber barons: The great American capitalists, 1861-1901'' (1934)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettigrew|first=Richard Franklin|title=Triumphant Plutocracy: The Story of American Public Life from 1870 to 1920|year=2010|publisher=Nabu Press|isbn=1146542747}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=foreword by Vincent P.

By 1890 American industrial production and per capita income exceeded those of all other world nations. In response to heavy debts and decreasing farm prices, wheat and cotton farmers joined the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mintz|first=Steven|title=Learn About the Gilded Age|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/modules/gilded_age/index.cfm |work=Digital History|publisher=University of Houston|date=June 5, 2008|accessdate=June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unprecedented wave of [[immigration to the United States|immigration]] from Europe served to both provide the labor for American industry and create diverse communities in previously undeveloped areas. From 1880 to 1914, peak years of immigration, more than 22 million people migrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.theusaonline.com/people/growth.htm Growth of U.S. Population]&quot;. TheUSAonline.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most were unskilled workers who quickly found jobs in mines, mills, factories. Many immigrants were craftsmen (especially from Britain and Germany) bringing human skills, and others were farmers (especially from Germany and Scandinavia) who purchased inexpensive land on the Prairies from railroads who sent agents to Europe. Poverty, growing inequality and dangerous working conditions, along with [[History of the socialist movement in the United States|socialist]] and [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchist]] ideas diffusing from European immigrants, led to the rise of the [[Labor history of the United States|labor movement]], which often included violent strikes.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Katie (June 12, 2007).

Skilled workers banded together to control their crafts and raise wages by forming labor unions in industrial areas of the Northeast. Before the 1930s few factory workers joined the [[Labor history of the United States|unions in the labor movement]]. [[Samuel Gompers]] led the [[American Federation of Labor]] 1886-1924, coordinating multiple unions. Industrial growth was very rapid, led by [[John D. Rockefeller]] in oil and [[Andrew Carnegie]] in steel; both became leaders of philanthropy, giving away their fortunes to create the modern system of hospitals, universities, libraries, and foundations.

A severe nationwide depression broke out in 1893; it was called the [[Panic of 1893]] and impacted farmers, workers, and businessmen who saw prices, wages, and profits fall.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hoffmann, &quot;The Depression of the Nineties,&quot; ''Journal of Economic History'' (1956) 16#2 pp 137–164. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2114113 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Many railroads went bankrupt. The resultant political reaction fell on the Democratic Party, whose leader President [[Grover Cleveland]] shouldered much of the blame. Labor unrest involved numerous strikes, most notably the violent [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894, which was shut down by federal troops under Cleveland's orders. The [[People's Party (United States)|Populist Party]] gained strength among cotton and wheat farmers, as well as coal miners, but was overtaken by the even more popular [[Free Silver]] movement, which demanded using silver to enlarge the money supply, leading to inflation that the silverites promised would end the depression.&lt;ref&gt;Worth Robert Miller, &quot;A Centennial Historiography of American Populism,&quot; ''Kansas History'' (1993) 16#1 pp 54-69. [http://history.missouristate.edu/wrmiller/Populism/texts/historiography.htm online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The financial, railroad, and business communities fought back hard, arguing that only the gold standard would save the economy. In the most intense election in the nation's history, conservative Republican [[William McKinley]] defeated silverite [[William Jennings Bryan]], who ran on the Democratic, Populist, and Silver Republican tickets. Bryan swept the South and West, but McKinley ran up landslides among the middle class, industrial workers, cities, and among upscale farmers in the Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William D.

Prosperity returned under McKinley, the gold standard was enacted, and the tariff was raised. By 1900 the US had the strongest economy on the globe. Apart from two short recessions (in 1907 and 1920) the overall economy remained prosperous and growing until 1929. Republicans, citing McKinley's policies, took the credit.&lt;ref&gt;H.

===Progressive Era===
{{Main article|Progressive Era}}
Dissatisfaction on the part of the growing middle class with the corruption and inefficiency of politics as usual, and the failure to deal with increasingly important urban and industrial problems, led to the dynamic [[Progressive Movement]] starting in the 1890s. In every major city and state, and at the national level as well, and in education, medicine, and industry, the progressives called for the modernization and reform of decrepit institutions, the elimination of corruption in politics, and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change. Leading politicians from both parties, most notably [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Charles Evans Hughes]], and [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert LaFollette]] on the Republican side, and [[William Jennings Bryan]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] on the Democratic side, took up the cause of progressive reform. Women became especially involved in demands for woman suffrage, prohibition, and better schools; their most prominent leader was [[Jane Addams]] of Chicago. [[Muckraker|&quot;Muckraking&quot; journalists]] such as [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Lincoln Steffens]] and [[Jacob Riis]] exposed corruption in business and government along with rampant inner city poverty. Progressives implemented anti-trust laws and regulated such industries of meat-packing, drugs, and railroads. Four new constitutional amendments&amp;nbsp;– the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth]] through [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth]]&amp;nbsp;– resulted from progressive activism, bringing the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, prohibition, and woman suffrage.&lt;ref name=&quot;digital history progressive&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Mintz|first=Steven|title=Learn About the Progressive Era|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/modules/progressivism/index.cfm|work=Digital History|publisher=[[University of Houston]]|year=2006|accessdate=February 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Progressive Movement lasted through the 1920s; the most active period was 1900–18.&lt;ref&gt;George Mowry, ''The Era of Theodore Roosevelt and the Birth of Modern America, 1900–1912'' (Harpers, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperialism===
{{Further information|American imperialism}}
The United States emerged as a world economic and military power after 1890. The main episode was the [[Spanish–American War]], which began when Spain refused American demands to reform its oppressive policies in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Paterson. &quot;United States Intervention in Cuba, 1898: Interpretations of the Spanish–American–Cuban–Filipino War,&quot; ''The History Teacher'' (1996) 29#3 pp. 341–61 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/494551 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The &quot;splendid little war&quot;, as one official called it, involved a series of quick American victories on land and at sea. At the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] peace conference the United States acquired the [[Philippines]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Guam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrington&quot;&gt;Fred H. Harrington,  &quot;The Anti-Imperialist Movement in the United States, 1898–1900,&quot; ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1935) 22#2 pp. 211–30 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1898467 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba became an independent country, under close American tutelage. Although the war itself was widely popular, the peace terms proved controversial. William Jennings Bryan led his Democratic Party in opposition to control of the Philippines, which he denounced as [[American imperialism|imperialism]] unbecoming to American democracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrington&quot;/&gt;  President [[William McKinley]] defended the acquisition and was riding high as the nation had returned to prosperity and felt triumphant in the war. McKinley easily defeated Bryan in a rematch in the [[United States presidential election, 1900|1900 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Bailey, &quot;Was the Presidential Election of 1900 a Mandate on Imperialism?&quot; ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1937)  24#1 pp 43–52 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1891336 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

After defeating an [[Philippine–American War|insurrection by Filipino nationalists]], the United States engaged in a large-scale program to modernize the economy of the Philippines and dramatically upgrade the public health facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Stanley, ''A Nation in the Making: The Philippines and the United States, 1899–1921'' (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1908, however, Americans lost interest in an empire and turned their international attention to the Caribbean, especially the building of the [[Panama Canal]]. In 1912 when Arizona became the final [[Contiguous United States|mainland state]], the [[American Frontier]] came to an end. The canal opened in 1914 and increased trade with Japan and the rest of the Far East. A key innovation was the [[Open Door Policy]], whereby the imperial powers were given equal access to Chinese business, with not one of them allowed to take control of China.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J.

As [[World War I]] raged in Europe from 1914, President Woodrow Wilson took full control of foreign policy, declaring neutrality but warning Germany that resumption of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] against American ships supplying goods to Allied nations would mean war. Germany decided to take the risk and try to win by cutting off supplies to Britain; the U.S. declared war in April 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=World War I: Encyclopedia |editors=Roberts, Priscilla Mary and Spencer Tucker |title=Germany's Decision for Unrestricted Submarine Warfare and Its Impact on the U.S. Declaration of War |last=McNabb |first=James B. |pages=482–83 |year=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&amp;pg=PA482 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  American money, food, and munitions arrived quickly, but troops had to be drafted and trained; by summer 1918 American soldiers under General [[John J. Pershing]] arrived at the rate of 10,000 a day, while Germany was unable to replace its losses.&lt;ref&gt;Edward M. Coffman, ''The War to End All Wars: The American Military Experience in World War I'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was  [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory in November 1918. President Wilson demanded Germany depose the Kaiser and accept his terms, the [[Fourteen Points]]. Wilson dominated the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]] but Germany was treated harshly by the Allies in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) as Wilson put all his hopes in the new [[League of Nations]]. Wilson refused to compromise with Senate Republicans over the issue of Congressional power to declare war, and the Senate rejected the Treaty and the League.&lt;ref&gt;John Milton Cooper, ''Breaking the Heart of the World: Woodrow Wilson and the Fight for the League of Nations'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

The women's suffrage movement began with the June 1848 National Convention of the [[Liberty Party (1840s)|Liberty Party]]. Presidential candidate [[Gerrit Smith]] argued for and established women's suffrage as a party plank. One month later, his cousin [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] joined with [[Lucretia Mott]] and other women to organize the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], featuring the [[Declaration of Sentiments]] demanding equal rights for women, and the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Seneca Falls Convention]] was preceded by the [[Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women]] in 1837 held in New York City, at which women's rights issues were debated, especially African-American women's rights. {{Cite book|last1=Gordon |first1=Ann D. |authorlink1=Ann D.

The women's rights campaign during &quot;[[first-wave feminism]]&quot; was led by Stanton, [[Lucy Stone]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]], among many others. Stone and [[Paulina Wright Davis]] organized the prominent and influential [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in 1850. The movement reorganized after the Civil War, gaining experienced campaigners, many of whom had worked for prohibition in the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]]. By the end of the 19th century a few western states had granted women full voting rights,&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca J. Mead, ''How the Vote Was Won: Woman Suffrage in the Western United States, 1868–1914'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; though women had made significant legal victories, gaining rights in areas such as property and child custody.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glenda Riley 2001&quot;&gt;Glenda Riley, ''Inventing the American Woman: An Inclusive History'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1912 the [[feminist movement]], which had grown sluggish, began to reawaken, putting an emphasis on its demands for equality and arguing that the corruption of American politics demanded purification by women because men could not do that job.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aileen S. Kraditor]], ''The Ideas of the Woman Suffrage Movement: 1890–1920'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Protests became increasingly common as suffragette [[Alice Paul]] led parades through the capital and major cities. Paul split from the large [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA), which favored a more moderate approach and supported the Democratic Party and Woodrow Wilson, led by [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], and formed the more militant [[National Woman's Party]]. Suffragists were arrested during their &quot;[[Silent Sentinels]]&quot; pickets at the White House, the first time such a tactic was used, and were taken as [[political prisoner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Adams and Michael L. Keene, ''Alice Paul and the American Suffrage Campaign'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The old anti-suffragist argument that only men could fight a war, and therefore only men deserve the right to vote, was refuted by the enthusiastic participation of tens of thousands of American women on the home front in World War I. Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman [[Jeannette Rankin]] of Montana, demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting. Congress passed the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] in 1919, and women could vote in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Frost-Knappman and Kathryn Cullen-Dupont, ''Women's Suffrage in America'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

NAWSA became the [[League of Women Voters]], and the National Woman's Party began lobbying for full equality and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], which would pass Congress during the second wave of the women's movement in 1972. Politicians responded to the new electorate by emphasizing issues of special interest to women, especially prohibition, child health, and world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Dumenil, ''The Modern Temper: American Culture and Society in the 1920s'' (1995)  pp 98–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristi Andersen, ''After Suffrage: Women in Partisan and Electoral Politics before the New Deal'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  The main surge of women voting came in 1928, when the big-city machines realized they needed the support of women to elect [[Al Smith]], a Catholic from New York City. Meanwhile, Protestants mobilized women to support Prohibition and vote for Republican [[Herbert Hoover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Allan J.

In the 1920s the U.S. grew steadily in stature as an economic and military world power. The United States Senate did not ratify the [[Treaty of Versailles]] imposed by its [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] on the defeated [[Central Powers]]; instead, the United States chose to pursue [[unilateralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Feature: World War I and isolationism, 1913–33|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1584/is_n17_v2/ai_11173912/ |publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=April 29, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aftershock of Russia's [[October Revolution]] resulted in real fears of Communism in the United States, leading to a [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] and the deportation of aliens considered subversive.

While public health facilities grew rapidly in the Progressive Era, and hospitals and medical schools were modernized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rodney P. Carlisle|title=Handbook to Life in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYwn0je9MfYC&amp;pg=PT245|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=245ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nation in 1918 lost 675,000 lives to the [[Spanish flu]] pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.hhs.gov/nvpo/pandemics/flu3.htm |title=Pandemics and Pandemic Scares in the 20th Century |publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, the manufacture, sale, import and export of alcohol were prohibited by the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]], [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. The result was that in cities illegal alcohol became a big business, largely controlled by racketeers. The second [[Ku Klux Klan]] grew rapidly in 1922-25, then collapsed. Immigration laws were passed to strictly limit the number of new entries. The 1920s were called  the [[Roaring Twenties]] due to the great economic prosperity during this period. [[Jazz]] became popular among the younger generation, and thus the decade was also called the [[Jazz Age]].

[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dorothea Lange]]'s ''Migrant Mother'' depicts destitute pea pickers in California, centering on [[Florence Owens Thompson]], a mother of seven, age 32, in [[Nipomo, California]], March 1936.]]
The Great Depression (1929–39) and the New Deal (1933–36) were decisive moments in American political, economic, and social history that reshaped the nation.&lt;ref&gt;For a comprehensive history by a leading scholar see David M. Kennedy, ''Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929–1945'' (Oxford History of the United States) (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, the nation enjoyed widespread prosperity, albeit with a weakness in agriculture. A financial bubble was fueled by an inflated [[stock market]], which later led to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Stock Market Crash]] on October 29, 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shlaes|2008|pp=85, 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, along with [[causes of the Great Depression|many other economic factors]], triggered a worldwide [[economic depression|depression]] known as the [[Great Depression]]. During this time, the United States experienced [[deflation (economics)|deflation]] as prices fell, unemployment soared from 3% in 1929 to 25% in 1933, farm prices fell by half, and manufacturing output plunged by one-third.

In 1932, [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nominee [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] promised &quot;a [[New Deal]] for the American people&quot;, coining the enduring label for his domestic policies. The desperate economic situation, along with the substantial Democratic victories in the 1932 elections, gave Roosevelt unusual influence over Congress in the &quot;First Hundred Days&quot; of his administration. He used his leverage to win rapid passage of a series of measures to create welfare programs and regulate the banking system, stock market, industry, and agriculture, along with many other government efforts to end the Great Depression and reform the American economy. The New Deal regulated much of the economy, especially the financial sector. It provided relief to the unemployed through numerous programs, such as the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) and (for young men) the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. Large scale spending projects designed to provide high paying jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the [[Public Works Administration]]. Roosevelt turned left in 1935–36, building up labor unions through the [[Wagner Act]]. Unions became a powerful element of the merging [[New Deal Coalition]], which won reelection for Roosevelt in 1936, 1940, and 1944 by mobilizing union members, blue collar workers, relief recipients, big city machines, ethnic, and religious groups (especially Catholics and Jews) and the white South, along with blacks in the North (where they could vote). Some of the programs were dropped in the 1940s when the conservatives regained power in Congress through the [[Conservative Coalition]]. Of special importance is the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security program]], begun in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Kennedy, &quot;What the New Deal Did,&quot; ''Political Science Quarterly,'' (Summer 2009) 124#2 pp 251–68&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===

{{Further information|World War II|Military history of the United States during World War II|United States home front during World War II}}

In the Depression years, the United States remained focused on domestic concerns while democracy declined across the world and many countries fell under the control of dictators. [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] asserted dominance in East Asia and in the Pacific. [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] militarized too and threatened conquests, while Britain and France attempted [[appeasement]] to avert another war in Europe. US legislation in the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] sought to avoid foreign conflicts; however, policy clashed with increasing anti-Nazi feelings following the German [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 that started World War II. Roosevelt positioned the US as the &quot;[[Arsenal of Democracy]]&quot;, pledging full-scale financial and munitions support for the Allies&amp;nbsp;– but no military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Black, ''Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom'' (2003) pp 648–82&lt;/ref&gt; Japan tried to neutralize America's power in the Pacific by [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacking Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, which catalyzed American support to enter the war and seek revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon W. Prange, Donald M. Goldstein and Katherine V. Dillon, ''At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

The main contributions of the US to the Allied war effort comprised money, industrial output, food, petroleum, technological innovation, and (especially 1944–45), military personnel. Much of the focus in Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation. The overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP, the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas, the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40% of the GDP went to the war effort. This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low-productivity occupations to high efficiency jobs, improvements in productivity through better technology and management, and the move into the active labor force of students, retired people, housewives, and the unemployed, and an increase in hours worked.

It was exhausting; leisure activities declined sharply. People tolerated the extra work because of patriotism, the pay, and the confidence that it was only &quot;for the duration&quot;, and life would return to normal as soon as the war was won. Most durable goods became unavailable, and meat, clothing, and gasoline were tightly rationed. In industrial areas housing was in short supply as people doubled up and lived in cramped quarters. Prices and wages were controlled, and Americans saved a high portion of their incomes, which led to renewed growth after the war instead of a return to depression.&lt;ref&gt;Harold G. Vatter, ''The U.S. Economy in World War II'' (1988) pp 27–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Kennedy, ''Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929–1945'' (2001) pp 615–68&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]&amp;nbsp;– the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union, China, as well as Poland, Canada and other countries&amp;nbsp;– fought the [[Axis powers]] of Germany, Italy, and Japan. The Allies saw Germany as the main threat and gave highest priority to Europe. The US dominated the war against Japan and stopped Japanese expansion in the Pacific in 1942. After losing Pearl Harbor and in the Philippines to the Japanese, and drawing the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] (May 1942), the American Navy inflicted a decisive blow at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] (June 1942). American ground forces assisted in the [[North African Campaign]] that eventually concluded with the collapse of Mussolini's fascist government in 1943, as Italy switched to the Allied side. A more significant European front was opened on [[D-Day]], June 6, 1944, in which American and Allied forces invaded Nazi-occupied France from Britain.

[[File:Eisenhower bronze.jpg|150px|thumb|upright|Bronze statue of [[Eisenhower]] at [[United States Capitol rotunda|Capitol rotunda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/eisenhower.cfm |title=Dwight D. Eisenhower |accessdate=November 29, 2008 |work=aoc.gov |publisher=Architect of the Capitol }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On the [[United States home front during World War II|home front]], mobilization of the US economy was managed by Roosevelt's [[War Production Board]]. The wartime production boom led to full employment, wiping out this vestige of the Great Depression. Indeed, [[labor shortage]]s encouraged industry to look for new sources of workers, finding new roles for women and blacks.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Kennedy, ''Freedom from Fear'' (1999) pp 615–68&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the fervor also inspired [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States|anti-Japanese sentiment]], which was handled by [[Japanese American internment|removing everyone of Japanese descent from the West Coast war zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Daniels, ''Prisoners Without Trial: Japanese Americans in World War II'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Research and development]] took flight as well, best seen in the [[Manhattan Project]], a secret effort to harness [[nuclear fission]] to produce highly destructive [[atomic bomb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rhodes, ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allies pushed the Germans out of France but faced an unexpected counterattack at the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December. The final German effort failed, and, as Allied armies in East and West were converging on Berlin, the Nazis hurriedly tried to kill the last remaining Jews. The western front stopped short, leaving Berlin to the Soviets as the Nazi regime formally capitulated in May 1945, ending the war in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Ambrose, ''Eisenhower and Berlin, 1945: The Decision to Halt at the Elbe'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Over in the Pacific, the US implemented an [[leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping strategy]] toward Tokyo, establishing airfields for bombing runs against mainland Japan from the [[Mariana Islands]] and achieving hard-fought victories at [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald H.

Finn, ''Winners in Peace: MacArthur, Yoshida, and Postwar Japan'' (1992) pp 43–103&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Roosevelt coined the term &quot;[[Four Policemen|Four Powers]]&quot; to refer four major Allies of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and China, which later became the foundation of the United Nations Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaddis|first=John Lewis|title=The United States and the Origins of the Cold War, 1941–1947|year=1972|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-12239-9|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participation in postwar foreign affairs marked the end of predominant American isolationism. The awesome threat of nuclear weapons inspired both [[nuclear power debate|optimism]] and [[mutual assured destruction|fear]]. Nuclear weapons were never used after 1945, as both sides drew back from the brink and a &quot;long peace&quot; characterized the [[Cold War]] years, starting with the [[Harry Truman|Truman]] [[Truman Doctrine|Doctrine]] in May 22, 1947. There were, however, regional wars in [[Korean War|Korea]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lewis Gaddis 1989&quot;&gt;John Lewis Gaddis, ''The Long Peace: Inquiries Into the History of the Cold War'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cold War, counterculture, and civil rights===
{{Main article|History of the United States (1945–64)|History of the United States (1964–80)|United States in the 1950s}}
[[File:President Kennedy addresses nation on Civil Rights, 11 June 1963.jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]'s [[Civil Rights Address]], June 11, 1963.]]

Following World War II, the United States emerged as one of the two dominant superpowers, the [[USSR]] being the other. The [[U.S. Senate]] on a bipartisan vote approved U.S. participation in the United Nations (UN), which marked a turn away from the traditional [[isolationism]] of the U.S. and toward increased international involvement.

The primary American goal of 1945–48 was to rescue Europe from the devastation of World War II and to contain the expansion of Communism, represented by the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 provided military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey to counteract the threat of Communist expansion in the Balkans. In 1948, the United States replaced piecemeal financial aid programs with a comprehensive [[Marshall Plan]], which pumped money into the economy of Western Europe, and removed trade barriers, while modernizing the managerial practices of businesses and governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lewis Gaddis 2005&quot;&gt;John Lewis Gaddis, ''The Cold War: A New History'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plan's $13 billion budget was in the context of a US GDP of $258 billion in 1948 and was in addition to the $12 billion in American aid given to Europe between the end of the war and the start of the Marshall Plan. Soviet head of state [[Joseph Stalin]] prevented [[Eastern Bloc|his satellite states]] from participating, and from that point on, Eastern Europe, with inefficient centralized economies, fell further and further behind Western Europe in terms of economic development and prosperity. In 1949, the United States, rejecting the long-standing policy of no military alliances in peacetime, formed the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) alliance, which continues into the 21st century. In response the Soviets formed the [[Warsaw Pact]] of communist states.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lewis Gaddis 2005&quot;/&gt;

In August 1949 the Soviets tested their first nuclear weapon, thereby escalating the risk of warfare. Indeed, the threat of [[mutually assured destruction]] prevented both powers from going too far, and resulted in proxy wars, especially in [[Korean War|Korea]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], in which the two sides did not directly confront each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lewis Gaddis 1989&quot;/&gt;  Within the United States, the Cold War prompted concerns about [[Second Red Scare|Communist influence]]. The unexpected leapfrogging of American technology by the Soviets in 1957 with [[Sputnik]], the first Earth satellite, began the [[Space Race]], won by the Americans as [[Apollo 11]] landed astronauts on the moon in 1969. The angst about the weaknesses of American education led to large-scale federal support for [[Science education#United States|science education]] and research.&lt;ref&gt;James  T. Patterson, ''Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945–1974'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades after World War II, the United States became a global influence in economic, political, military, cultural, and technological affairs. Beginning in the 1950s, middle-class culture became obsessed with consumer goods. [[White Americans]] made up nearly 90% of the population in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/tab01.pdf |title=Table 1.

In [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]], the charismatic politician [[John F. Kennedy]] was elected as the first and&amp;nbsp;– thus far&amp;nbsp;– only Roman Catholic President of the United States. The Kennedy family brought a new life and vigor to the atmosphere of the [[White House]]. His time in office was marked by such notable events as the acceleration of the United States' role in the [[Space Race]], escalation of the American role in the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Cuban missile crisis]], the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], the jailing of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] during the [[Birmingham campaign]], and the appointment of his brother [[Robert F. Kennedy]] to his Cabinet as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy was assassinated]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, on November 22, 1963, leaving the nation in profound shock.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O'Brien, ''John F. Kennedy: A Biography'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climax of liberalism====
The climax of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] came in the mid-1960s with the success of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (1963–69) in securing congressional passage of his [[Great Society]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Alterman and Kevin Mattson, ''The Cause: The Fight for American Liberalism from Franklin Roosevelt to Barack Obama'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  They included civil rights, the end of [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], extension of welfare, federal aid to education at all levels, subsidies for the arts and humanities, environmental activism, and a series of programs designed to wipe out poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dallek, ''Lyndon B. Johnson: Portrait of a President'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irving Bernstein, ''Guns or Butter: The Presidency of Lyndon Johnson'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; As recent historians have explained:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Gradually, liberal intellectuals crafted a new vision for achieving economic and social justice. The liberalism of the early 1960s contained no hint of radicalism, little disposition to revive new deal era crusades against concentrated economic power, and no intention to fast and class passions or redistribute wealth or restructure existing institutions. Internationally it was strongly anti-Communist. It aimed to defend the free world, to encourage economic growth at home, and to ensure that the resulting plenty was fairly distributed. Their agenda-much influenced by Keynesian economic theory-envisioned massive public expenditure that would speed economic growth, thus providing the public resources to fund larger welfare, housing, health, and educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Edwin Harrell|David Edwin Harrell, Jr.]], Edwin S. Gaustad, John B. Boles, Sally Foreman Griffith, Randall M. Miller, Randall B. Woods, ''Unto a Good Land: A History of the American People'' (2005) pp 1052–53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:RFK and MLK together.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], June 22, 1963, Washington, D.C.]]
Johnson was rewarded with an [[United States presidential election, 1964|electoral landslide in 1964]] against conservative [[Barry Goldwater]], which broke the decades-long control of Congress by the [[Conservative coalition]]. However, the Republicans bounced back in 1966 and elected [[Richard Nixon]] in 1968. Nixon largely continued the New Deal and Great Society programs he inherited; conservative reaction would come with the election of [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Schneider, The Conservative Century: From Reaction to Revolution (Rowman &amp; Littlefield. 2009) ch 5&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the American people completed a great migration from farms into the cities and experienced a period of sustained economic expansion.

====Civil Rights Movement====

Starting in the late 1950s, institutionalized [[racism in the United States|racism across the United States]], but especially in the [[Southern United States|South]], was increasingly challenged by the growing Civil Rights movement. The activism of African-American leaders [[Rosa Parks]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] led to the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], which launched the movement. For years African Americans would struggle with violence against them&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Holloway, ''Getting Away With Murder: The Twentieth-Century Struggle for Civil Rights in the U.S. Senate'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; but would achieve great steps toward equality with Supreme Court decisions, including ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' and ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], and the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]], which ended the [[Jim Crow laws]] that legalized [[racial segregation]] between whites and blacks.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Dierenfield, ''The Civil Rights Movement'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Luther King, Jr., who had won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his efforts to achieve equality of the races, was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|assassinated in 1968]]. Following his death others led the movement, most notably King's widow, [[Coretta Scott King]], who was also active, like her husband, in the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War]], and in the [[Feminist Movement in the United States|Women's Liberation Movement]]. There were 164 riots in 128 American cities in the first nine months of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lindsey Lupo|title=Flak-Catchers: One Hundred Years of Riot Commission Politics in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pmeKBTPzj3gC&amp;pg=PA123|year=2010|publisher=Lexington Books|pages=123–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black Power]] emerged during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The decade would ultimately bring about positive strides toward integration, especially in government service, sports, and entertainment. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] turned to the federal courts to fight for their land rights. They held protests highlighting the federal government's failure to honor treaties. One of the most outspoken Native American groups was the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM). In the 1960s, [[Cesar Chavez]] began organizing poorly paid [[Mexican-American]] farm workers in California. He led a five-year-long strike by grape pickers. Then Chávez formed the nation's first successful union of farm workers. His [[United Farm Workers of America]] (UFW)  faltered after a few years but after Chavez died in 1993 he became an iconic &quot;folk saint&quot; in the pantheon of Mexican Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Jacobs|title=Mexican American Literature: The Politics of Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nLwAihlibcC&amp;pg=PA13|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Women's Movement====
{{Further information|Second-wave feminism}}
[[File:Gloria Steinem at news conference, Women's Action Alliance, January 12, 1972.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Gloria Steinem]] at a meeting of the [[Women's Action Alliance]], 1972.]]

A new consciousness of the inequality of American women began sweeping the nation, starting with the 1963 publication of [[Betty Friedan]]'s best-seller, ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', which explained how many [[homemakers|housewives]] felt trapped and unfulfilled, assaulted American culture for its creation of the notion that women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives, mothers, and keepers of the home, and argued that women were just as able as men to do every type of job. In 1966 Friedan and others established the [[National Organization for Women]], or NOW, to act for women as the [[NAACP]] did for African Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glenda Riley 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angela Howard Zophy, ed.

Protests began, and the new Women's Liberation Movement grew in size and power, gained much media attention, and, by 1968, had replaced the Civil Rights Movement as the US's main social revolution. Marches, parades, rallies, boycotts, and pickets brought out thousands, sometimes millions. There were striking gains for women in medicine, law, and business, while only a few were elected to office. The Movement was split into factions by political ideology early on, however (with NOW on the left, the [[Women's Equity Action League]] (WEAL) on the right, the [[National Women's Political Caucus]] (NWPC) in the center, and more radical groups formed by younger women on the far left). The proposed [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the Constitution, passed by Congress in 1972 was defeated by a conservative coalition mobilized by [[Phyllis Schlafly]]. They argued that it degraded the position of the housewife and made young women susceptible to the [[conscription in the United States|military draft]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald T. Critchlow, ''Phyllis Schlafly and Grassroots Conservatism: A Woman's Crusade'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane J. Mansbridge, ''Why We Lost the ERA'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many federal laws (i.e., those [[equal Pay Act of 1963|equalizing pay]], [[Title VII|employment]], [[Title IX|education]], [[Equal Employment Opportunity Act|employment opportunities]], and [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act|credit]]; [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act|ending pregnancy discrimination]]; and requiring [[NASA]], the [[Military Academies]], and other organizations to admit women), state laws (i.e., those ending [[spousal abuse]] and [[spousal rape|marital rape]]), Supreme Court rulings (i.e. ruling that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied to women), and state ERAs established women's equal status under the law, and social custom and consciousness began to change, accepting women's equality. The controversial issue of abortion, deemed by the Supreme Court as a [[fundamental right]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973), is still a [[abortion debate|point of debate]] today.&lt;ref&gt;Donald T.

====The Counterculture Revolution and Cold War Détente====
{{Main article|History of the United States (1964–80)}} &lt;!-- This section and the &quot;Climax of liberalism&quot; section significantly overlap in coverage. --&gt;
Amid the Cold War, the United States entered the [[Vietnam War]], whose growing unpopularity fed already existing social movements, including those among women, minorities, and young people. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] social programs and numerous rulings by the [[Warren Court]] added to the wide range of [[social reform]] during the 1960s and 1970s. [[Feminism]] and the [[environmental movement]] became political forces, and progress continued toward [[civil rights]] for all Americans. The [[counterculture of the 1960s|Counterculture Revolution]] swept through the nation and much of the western world in the late sixties and early seventies, further dividing Americans in a &quot;culture war&quot; but also bringing forth more liberated social views.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Chapman, ''Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Voices, and Viewpoints'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:F-4B VF-151 CV-41 TU-95.jpg|right|thumb|United States Navy [[F-4 Phantom II]] shadows a Soviet [[Tu-95 Bear]] D aircraft in the early 1970s]]
Johnson was succeeded in 1969 by Republican [[Richard Nixon]], who [[Vietnamization|attempted to gradually turn the war over to]] the [[South Vietnamese]] forces. He negotiated the [[Paris Peace Accords|peace treaty in 1973]] which secured the release of POWs and led to the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The war had cost the lives of 58,000 American troops. Nixon manipulated the fierce distrust between the Soviet Union and China to the advantage of the United States, achieving ''[[détente]]'' (relaxation; ease of tension) with both parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Robert Greene 1995&quot;&gt;John Robert Greene, ''The Presidency of Gerald R. Ford'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Watergate scandal]], involving Nixon's cover-up of his operatives' break-in into the [[Democratic National Committee]] headquarters at the [[Watergate complex|Watergate office complex]] destroyed his political base, sent many aides to prison, and forced Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974. He was succeeded by Vice President [[Gerald Ford]]. The [[Fall of Saigon]] ended the Vietnam War and resulted in North and South [[Vietnam]] being reunited. Communist victories in neighboring [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]] occurred in the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Robert Greene 1995&quot;/&gt;

The [[1973 oil crisis|OPEC oil embargo]] marked a long-term economic transition since, for the first time, energy prices skyrocketed, and American factories faced serious competition from foreign automobiles, clothing, electronics, and consumer goods. By the late 1970s the economy suffered an [[1970s Energy Crisis|energy crisis]], slow economic growth, high unemployment, and very high inflation coupled with high interest rates (the term [[stagflation]] was coined). Since economists agreed on the wisdom of [[deregulation]], many of the New Deal era regulations were ended, such as in transportation, banking, and telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Derthick, ''The Politics of Deregulation'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jimmy Carter]], running as someone who was not a part of the Washington political establishment, was elected president in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/peopleevents/e_1976.html |title=People &amp; Events: The Election of 1976 |work=American Experience |publisher=PBS |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the world stage, Carter brokered the [[Camp David Accords]] between Israel and Egypt. In 1979, Iranian students stormed the US embassy in [[Tehran]] and took 66 Americans hostage, resulting in the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. With the hostage crisis and continuing stagflation, Carter lost the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 election]] to the Republican [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Urofsky |first=Melvin I. |title=The American Presidents |year=2000 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-8153-2184-2 |page=545 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DBa6WQ5XCowC&amp;pg=PA545}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, 1981, minutes after Carter's term in office ended, the remaining U.S. captives held at the U.S. embassy in Iran were released, ending the 444-day hostage crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/1/20 |title=Jan 20, 1981: Iran Hostage Crisis ends |work=This Day in History |publisher=History.com |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ReaganBerlinWall.jpg|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan]] at the [[Brandenburg Gate]] challenges Soviet premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to [[tear down this wall|tear down]] the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1987, shortly before the end of the [[Cold War]].]]

[[Ronald Reagan]] produced a major [[realigning election|realignment]] with his [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1984|1984]] landslide elections. Reagan's economic policies (dubbed &quot;[[Reaganomics]]&quot;) and the implementation of the [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981]] lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 28% over the course of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=5324&amp;type=0&amp;sequence=0 |title= Effective Federal Tax Rates: 1979–2001 | publisher = Bureau of Economic Analysis | date = July 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan continued to downsize government taxation and regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilentz|2008|pp=140–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US experienced a recession in 1982, but the negative indicators reversed, with the inflation rate decreasing from 11% to 2%, the unemployment rate decreasing from 10.8% in December 1982 to 7.5% in November 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miseryindex.us/urbymonth.asp |title=The United States Unemployment Rate |publisher=Miseryindex.us |date=November 8, 2008 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the economic growth rate increasing from 4.5% to 7.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilentz|2008|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan ordered a buildup of the US military, incurring additional budget deficits. Reagan introduced a complicated missile defense system known as the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) (dubbed &quot;Star Wars&quot; by opponents) in which, theoretically, the U.S. could shoot down missiles with laser systems in space. The Soviets reacted harshly because they thought it violated the 1972 [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]], and would upset the balance of power by giving the U.S. a major military advantage. For years Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] argued vehemently against SDI. However, by the late 1980s he decided the system would never work and should not be used to block disarmament deals with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Julian E. Zelizer|title=Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security--From World War II to the War on Terrorism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_gH5s4B2SEC&amp;pg=PA350|year=2010|publisher=Basic Books|pages=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians argue how great an impact the SDI threat had on the Soviets&amp;nbsp;– whether it was enough to force Gorbachev to initiate radical reforms, or whether the deterioration of the Soviet economy alone forced the reforms. There is agreement that the Soviets realized they were well behind the Americans in military technology, that to try to catch up would be very expensive, and that the military expenses were already a very heavy burden slowing down their economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;DijkGray2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruud van Dijk|title=Encyclopedia of the Cold War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QgX0bQ3Enj4C&amp;pg=PA863|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-135-92311-6|pages=863–64|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan's [[Invasion of Grenada]] and [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|bombing of Libya]] were popular in the US, though his backing of the [[Contras]] rebels was mired in the controversy over the [[Iran–Contra affair]] that revealed Reagan's poor management style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=John Ehrman|author2=Michael W.

Reagan met four times with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who ascended to power in 1985, and their summit conferences led to the signing of the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]]. Gorbachev tried to save Communism in the Soviet Union first by ending the expensive arms race with America,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilentz|2008|pp=243–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; then by shedding the East European empire in 1989. The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed]] on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] 1991, ending the US–Soviet [[Cold War]].

[[File:Nasdaq Composite dot-com bubble.svg|thumb|right|300px|The [[NASDAQ Composite]] index swelled with the [[dot-com bubble]] in the optimistic &quot;[[New Economy]]&quot;. The bubble burst in 2000.]]

The United States emerged as the world's sole remaining superpower and continued to intervene in international affairs during the 1990s, including the 1991 [[Gulf War]] against [[Iraq]]. Following [[United States presidential election, 1992|his election in 1992]], President [[Bill Clinton]] oversaw one of the longest periods of economic expansion and unprecedented gains in securities values, a side effect of the [[digital revolution]] and new business opportunities created by the Internet. He also worked with the Republican Congress to pass the first balanced federal budget in 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilentz 2008 400&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wilentz|2008|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[impeachment of Bill Clinton|Clinton was impeached]] by the House of Representatives on charges of lying about a sexual relationship with White House intern [[Monica Lewinsky]]. He was acquitted by the Senate. The failure of impeachment and the Democratic gains in the 1998 election forced House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]], a Republican, to resign from Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilentz 2008 400&quot;/&gt;

The GOP expanded its base throughout the South after 1968 (excepting 1976), largely due to its strength among [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] white Evangelical Protestants and traditionalist Roman Catholics, added to its traditional strength in the business community and suburbs. As white Democrats in the South lost dominance of the Democratic Party in the 1990s, the region took on the [[Two-party system|two-party]] apparatus which characterized most of the nation. The Republican Party's central leader by 1980 was [[Ronald Reagan]], whose [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] policies called for reduced government spending and regulation, lower taxes, and a strong anti-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] foreign policy.  His iconic status in the party persists into the 21st century, as practically all GOP leaders acknowledge his stature. Social scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue, &quot;The Republican party, nationally, moved from right-center toward the center in 1940s and 1950s, then moved right again in the 1970s and 1980s.&quot;  They add: &quot;The Democratic party, nationally, moved from left-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved further toward the right-center in the 1970s and 1980s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Theodore Caplow|author2=Howard M.

The [[United States presidential election, 2000|presidential election in 2000]] between [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]] was one of the closest in US history and helped lay the seeds for political polarization to come. The vote in the decisive state of Florida was extremely close and produced a dramatic [[Florida election recount|dispute over the counting of votes]]. The US Supreme Court in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' ended the recount with a 5–4 vote. That meant Bush, then in the lead, carried Florida and the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilentz|2008|pp=420–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Including 2000, the Democrats outpolled the Republicans in the national vote in every election from 1992 to 2012, except for 2004.

On September 11, 2001 (&quot;9/11&quot;), the United States was struck by a [[terrorism|terrorist attack]] when 19 [[al-Qaeda]] hijackers commandeered four airliners to be used in [[suicide attacks]] and intentionally crashed two into both twin towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and the third into [[the Pentagon]], killing 2,937 victims — 206 aboard the three airliners, 2,606 who were in the World Trade Center and on the ground, and 125 who were in the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;National Commission on Terrorist Attacks, ''The 9/11 Commission Report'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth plane was re-taken by the passengers and crew of the aircraft. While they were not able to land the plane safely, they were able to re-take control of the aircraft and crash it into an empty field in Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people including the four terrorists on board, thereby saving whatever target the terrorists were aiming for. All in all, a total of 2,977 victims perished in the attacks. In response, President [[George W. Bush]] on September 20 announced a &quot;War on Terror&quot;. On October 7, 2001, the United States and NATO then [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invaded Afghanistan]] to oust the [[Taliban]] regime, which had provided safe haven to al-Qaeda and its leader [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref&gt;David E. Sanger, ''Confront and Conceal: Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power'' (2012) ch 1, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government established new domestic efforts to prevent future attacks. The controversial [[USA PATRIOT Act]] increased the government's power to monitor communications and removed legal restrictions on information sharing between federal law enforcement and intelligence services. A cabinet-level agency called the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] was created to lead and coordinate federal [[counter-terrorism]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;Julian E.

In 2003, from March 19 to May 1, the United States launched [[2003 invasion of Iraq|an invasion of Iraq]], which led to the collapse of the [[Iraq]] government and the eventual capture of Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]], with whom the US had long-standing tense relations.

''The Presidency of George W.

In May 2011, after nearly a decade in hiding, the founder and leader of Al Qaeda, [[Osama bin Laden]], was killed in Pakistan in a raid conducted by US naval special forces acting under President Obama's direct orders.

The Boston Marathon Bombing was a bombing incident, followed by subsequent related shootings, that occurred when two pressure cooker bombs exploded during the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. The bombs exploded about 12 seconds and 210 yards (190 m) apart at 2:49 pm EDT, near the marathon's finish line on Boylston Street. They killed 3 people and injured an estimated 264 others.

The [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] - formerly known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq - rose to prominence in September 2014. In addition to taking control of much of Western Iraq and Eastern Syria, ISIS also beheaded three journalists, two American and one British. These events lead to [[2014 military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|a major military offensive]] by the USA and its allies in the region.

Following his election victory by a wide electoral margin in [[United States presidential election, 2008|November 2008]], Bush's successor - [[Barack Obama]] - signed into law the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], which was a $787 billion economic stimulus aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening recession. Obama, like Bush, took steps to rescue the auto industry and prevent future economic meltdowns. These included a bailout of [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]], putting ownership temporarily in the hands of the government, and the &quot;[[cash for clunkers]]&quot; program which temporarily boosted new car sales.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rattner, ''Overhaul: An Insider's Account of the Obama Administration's Emergency Rescue of the Auto Industry'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Obama signs health care-20100323.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph|President [[Barack Obama]] signs the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].]]
From 2009 to 2010, the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]] passed major legislation such as the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bruce S. Jansson|title=The Reluctant Welfare State: Engaging History to Advance Social Work Practice in Contemporary Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSRALTDECQ4C&amp;pg=PA466|year= 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act]], which were signed into law by President Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert P. Watson|title=The Obama Presidency: A Preliminary Assessment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCnJk3QirFMC&amp;pg=PA103|year= 2012|publisher=SUNY Press|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], which resulted in a Republican-controlled House of Representatives and a Democratic-controlled Senate,&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Abramson et al. ''Change and Continuity in the 2008 and 2010 Elections'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Congress presided over a period of elevated gridlock and heated debates over whether or not raise the [[debt ceiling]], extend tax cuts for citizens making over $250,000 annually, and many other key issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investorplace.com/2011/12/congress-ends-2011-mired-in-gridlock/ |title=Congress Ends 2011 Mired in Gridlock |publisher=InvestorPlace |date=December 22, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ongoing debates led to President Obama signing the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]]. In the Fall of 2012, [[Mitt Romney]] challenged Barack Obama for the Presidency. Following Obama's reelection in November 2012, Congress passed the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]] - which resulted in an increase in taxes primarily on those earning the most money. Congressional gridlock continued as Congressional Republicans' call for the repeal of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] - popularly known as &quot;Obamacare&quot; - along with other various demands, resulted in the [[2013 United States government shutdown|first government shutdown since the Clinton administration]] and almost led to the first default on [[U.S. debt]] since the 19th century. As a result of growing public frustration with both parties in Congress since the beginning of the decade, Congressional approval ratings fell to record lows, with only 11% of Americans approving as of October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/165281/congress-job-approval-falls-amid-gov-shutdown.aspx|title=Congress' Job Approval Falls to 11% Amid Gov't Shutdown|author=Gallup, Inc.|publisher=|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major events that have occurred during the 2010s include the rise of new political movements, such as the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Tea Party movement]] and the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Occupy movement]]. There was also unusually severe weather during the early part of the decade. In 2012, over half the country experienced record drought and [[Hurricane Sandy]] caused massive damage to coastal areas of New York and New Jersey.

The ongoing debate over the issue of rights for [[LGBT in the United States|the LGBT community]], most notably that of [[same-sex marriage]], began to shift in favor of same-sex couples, and has been reflected in dozens of polls released in the early part of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm|title=Civil Rights|publisher=|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, President Obama becoming the first president to openly support same-sex marriage, and the 2013 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in the case of [[United States v. Windsor]] provided for federal recognition of same-sex unions.  In June 2015, the United States Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationally in the case of [[Obergefell v. Hodges]].

Political debate has continued over issues such as [[tax reform]], [[immigration reform]], [[income inequality]] and US foreign policy in the [[Middle East]], particularly with regards to [[terrorism|global terrorism]], the rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], and an accompanying climate of [[Islamophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tottoli|first1=Roberto|title=Routledge Handbook of Islam in the West|date=2014|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 presidential election, the Republicans have focused most of their attack on the Obama administration. Senator [[Marco Rubio]], for example in the GOP debates, argues that &quot;Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country,&quot; citing Obamacare, the $800 billion stimulus, the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill and the nuclear deal with Iran. ''POLITICO'''s reporter comments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But whether or not you like what Obama has done, and none of the Republican candidates do, Rubio is correct that he has done an awful lot, transforming U.S. policy not only on health care, economics, financial regulation and Iran, but also on energy, education, taxation, gay rights, Iraq, Cuba and much more.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Grunwald, &quot;Why Rubio claims 'Obama knows what he's doing': Gaffe or no gaffe, it makes a lot of sense when you think about it,&quot; [http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/gop-debate-marco-rubio-performance-218885#ixzz3zVp7qpCa POLITICO Feb 7, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
