'''HMS ''Britomart''''' was a {{sclass|Halcyon|minesweeper||ship}} of the [[Royal Navy]]. She served during the [[Second World War]] and was sunk in 1944 in a [[friendly fire]] incident. The actor [[Robert Newton]] served aboard her.

==Construction and commissioning==
''Britomart'' was ordered on 11 August 1937 and was laid down at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]] on 1 January 1938. She was launched on 23 August that year, and commissioned on 24 August 1939. She was adopted by the civil community of [[Clowne]], Derbyshire in 1942 following a successful [[Warship Week]] National Savings campaign.

==Career==

===In the North Sea===
After completing contractors' trials in August 1939 she took up her war station in the [[North Sea]] as part of the 1st Minesweeping Flotilla. In September she joined the flotilla, consisting of [[HMS Bramble (J11)|HMS ''Bramble'']], [[HMS Hazard (J02)|''Hazard'']], [[HMS Hebe (J24)|''Hebe'']], [[HMS Sharpshooter (J68)|''Sharpshooter'']], [[HMS Speedy (J17)|''Speedy'']] and [[HMS Seagull (J85)|''Seagull'']] at [[Scapa Flow]]. They were subsequently deployed on minesweeping operations to ensure a clear passage for [[Home Fleet]] ships passing in and out of the Fleet anchorage. The flotilla carried out these duties until November, when they were transferred to the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] following the sinking of the [[battleship]] [[HMS Royal Oak (08)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']]. They were deployed at [[Greenock]]. They resumed service in the North Sea in December 1939, ensuring the passages through the East Coast Mine Barrier were kept clear of mines.

January 1940 saw the flotilla transferred for Atlantic convoy defence duties, based out of [[Stornoway]] and covering the passage of convoys to Canada.  ''Britomart'' and ''Bramble'' sailed for a refit in [[Leith]] in March which lasted until May. They rejoined the fleet at Scapa Flow in June and commenced their sweeping duties. This kept them occupied until February 1941, when ''Britomart'', ''Bramble'', ''Hebe'' and ''Sharpshooter'' were transferred to [[Harwich]] to sweep convoy routes as part of the [[Commander-in-Chief, The Nore|Nore Command]].  ''Britomart'' came under air attack on 15 March whilst sweeping off [[Rye, East Sussex]] and was hit by a bomb. It struck near the [[wardroom]], killing everyone inside and causing considerable damage. She made for [[Portsmouth]] under her own steam and escorted by ''Sharpshooter''. Her repairs lasted from April to May, and on her return to service in June she joined the 3rd Escort Group with HMS ''Hazard'' and ''Bramble''. August saw them based at Stornoway and deployed as local escorts for the Atlantic convoys, as well as their usual sweeping duties.

===With the Arctic convoys===
''Britomart'' was nominated in August 1941 for detached service in North Russia, carrying out sweeping duties to ensure the safe passage of [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Russian convoys]] to and from [[Iceland]]. Her sisters [[HMS Gossamer (J63)|HMS ''Gossamer'']], [[HMS Leda (J93)|''Leda'']] and [[HMS Hussar (J82)|''Hussar'']] were nominated at the same time, and ordered to join [[HMS Halcyon (J42)|HMS ''Halcyon'']], [[HMS Harrier (J71)|''Harrier'']] and [[HMS Salamander (J86)|''Salamander'']], which were already at [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]]. After preparing for Arctic service they sailed for Iceland in September and on 29 September they joined [[convoy PQ-1]] with the [[cruiser]] [[HMS Suffolk (55)|HMS ''Suffolk'']]. The convoy arrived at Archangel on 11 October and the flotilla commenced their Russian deployment. Between October 1941 and January 1942 ''Britomart'' was engaged in sweeping operations in the [[Barents Sea]], ensuring the safe movement of traffic in and out of the ports of Archangel and [[Murmansk]]. On 7 February she joined ''Sharpshooter'' in escorting the inward bound [[Convoy PQ 9|convoys PQ-9]] and [[Convoy PQ 10|PQ-10]] until their arrival in Murmansk on 10 February. On 13 February they joined the return [[convoy QP-7]] through the Barents Sea, before being detached on 15 February and returning to Murmansk.

===PQ-17===
''Britomart'' served in North Russia until March 1942, when she was nominated to return to the UK. On 21 March she and ''Sharpshooter'' joined the return [[convoy QP-9]] at [[Kola Inlet]]. They sailed with the convoy as far as [[Reykjavík]], which they reached on 3 April. They then sailed to the UK, where they were taken in hand for a refit. The refit lasted throughout May, during which time a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 271|Type 271 radar]] was fitted. She sailed for Reykjavík again in completion of these works and on 27 June 1942 joined [[convoy PQ-17]] with HMS ''Salamander'' and ''Halcyon''. The convoy was ordered to scatter by the [[Admiralty]] on 4 July in view of the presumed threat of attack by the German [[capital ship]]s [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']], [[German pocket battleship Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']] and [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|''Admiral Hipper'']].  ''Britomart'' was deployed on 5 July with several of the smaller escorts to search for the scattered merchant ships. She and the escorts gathered up six merchants and made for [[Novaya Zemlya]], whilst under continued air attack. The battered ships arrived at Archangel on 11 July, and ''Britomart'' resumed her sweeping duties.

===Sweeping in the Barents===
She carried these duties out throughout August 1942 and into September, and on 13 September was part of the local escort for [[Convoy QP 14]], with HMS ''Halcyon'', ''Hazard'' and ''Salamander''. On 18 September they joined two Soviet destroyers in escorting the inward bound [[Convoy PQ 18]], which had come under air attack. The convoy arrived on 20 September and ''Britomart'' resumed her sweeping duties. She was next deployed on 17 November with HMS ''Halcyon'', ''Hazard'', ''Salamander'' and ''Sharpshooter'' in escorting [[Convoy QP 15]] through the Barents Sea. They were detached on 20 November and returned to Archangel.  ''Britomart'' was briefly in the UK at the start of 1943, but was nominated to return to Russia as part of the escort for [[convoy JW-52]], and joined the assembled convoy at [[Loch Ewe]]. She deployed on 17 January with the [[corvette]]s [[HMS Lotus (K130)|HMS ''Lotus'']] and [[HMS Starwort (K20)|''Starwort'']], and three [[naval trawler]]s. The convoy came under air attack on 24 January, but these were ineffective. They arrived on 27 January and ''Britomart'' resumed her usual duties.

On 24 July 1943 she helped get a fire under control after an attack by four [[ Messerschmitt Bf-109]]s started a fire on the SS ''Llandaff''. The attack took place about {{convert|20|nmi|km}} NE of [[Kildin Island]]. ''Llandaff'' was part of a small convoy bringing timber from the [[White Sea]] to [[Kola Inlet]].

===Assigned to the Normandy landings===
She escorted several more convoys through the Barents in February 1943 and continued her sweeping duties until October. She briefly came under air attack whilst sweeping off Cape Article, and was hit by two bombs. They bounced off the deck without exploding.

She returned to the UK in November 1943, having escorted [[convoy RA-54A]] and after arriving on 14 November she underwent a refit. On completion of the refit she was nominated to join the newly formed 1st Minesweeping Flotilla, along with HMS ''Harrier'', [[HMS Gleaner (J83)|''Gleaner'']], [[HMS Halcyon (J42)|''Halcyon'']], ''Hussar'', [[HMS Jason (J99)|''Jason'']], ''Salamander'', [[HMS Seagull (J85)|''Seagull'']] and [[HMS Speedwell (J87)|''Speedwell'']]. Throughout February and March 1944 they carried out their duties in the North Sea, and were subsequently nominated for minesweeping support during the planned allied landings in Normandy ([[Operation Neptune]]).

They sailed for Portsmouth in April 1944 and joined Force S. They were instructed to clear the approach channels to the beach head anchorage areas, and had three [[Motor Launch]]es and four [[Isles class trawler|Isles class]] [[danlayer]]s attached to the flotilla for these duties.  ''Britomart'' took part in preparatory exercises with the ships of Force S, and carried out night sweeping exercises with the Flotilla. After briefings in Portsmouth she deployed in Channel 9 in advance of the assault convoys.

The operation was delayed by 24 hours on 4 June, and they sailed from the [[Solent]] on 5 June to commence operations. They carried out their sweeps, and on completion of this by 6 June they began clearing the anchorages. They were deployed on 8 June to begin widening the approach channels and carrying out defence patrols off the Eastern Task Force landing areas. They carried this out throughout July, under constant threat of attack from [[E-Boat]]s and [[midget submarine]]s. By August ''Britomart'' was deployed off [[Arromanches]] with HMS ''Harrier'', ''Jason'', ''Hussar'', ''Gleaner'' and ''Salamander''. They were transferred to the [[Le Havre]] area for mine sweeping operations in the anchorage selected for the bombardment of enemy positions by [[HMS Warspite (03)|HMS ''Warspite'']] and the [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s [[HMS Erebus (I02)|HMS ''Erebus'']] and [[HMS Roberts (F40)|''Roberts'']]. They came under shore fire on 23 August during these operations, but by 26 August they had received permission to remain in the area to complete the clearances instead of returning to Arromanches.

==Sinking==
Whilst carrying out these clearances on 27 August 1944, the flotilla came under rocket attack by [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Hawker Typhoon|Typhoon]]s.  ''Britomart'' and ''Hussar'' took direct hits and were sunk.  ''Salamander'' had her stern blown off and sustained heavy damage, while ''Jason'' was raked by machine gun fire, killing and wounding several of her crew. Two of the trawlers were also hit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halcyon-class.co.uk/FriendlyFire/friendly_fire.htm Sinking of Britomart]&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was found to be due to the failure of the Flag Officer British Assault Area to ensure that the approval of the extended minesweeping operation had been passed to those concerned with the air operations over the beaches. The ships were assumed to be enemy craft, since the air commanders believed that no allied ships were in the area at the time.

'''Italian submarine ''Alagi''''' was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Italian Adua class submarine|''Adua''-class submarine]] serving in the [[Regia Marina]] during [[World War II]]. She was named after the [[Amba Alagi]] mountain in [[Ethiopia]].

''Alagi'' was built in the [[Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico|CRDA]] shipyard, in [[Monfalcone]]. She was laid down on 19 March 1936, launched 15 November of the same year, and commissioned on 6 March 1937.

On 8 June 1942, ''Alagi'' torpedoed and sank the Italian destroyer ''Antoniotto Usodimare'' in a [[friendly fire]] incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 1942 torpedoed and damaged Turkish tanker ''Antares'' causing her to be beached on Ruad Island off Tripoli, Syria. The tanker was later refloated, towed to Turkey and scrapped.

In August 1942 ''Alagi'' operated along the Italian Fleet to intercept and block an Allied [[convoy]] to Malta ([[Operation Pedestal|Operation ''Pedestal'']]). She succeeded in damaging the [[Royal Navy]] cruiser {{HMS|Kenya|C14|6}}, and sinking the M/V ''Clan Ferguson'' on 12 August.

''Alagi'', a member of the 7th Group - 71st Squadron of the submarine fleet, was still operating on 8 September 1943, when the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and Italy signed the armistice. ''Alagi'' arrived in [[Malta]] with the Regia Marina fleet. She was sold for scrap on 1 February 1948.

'''HMS ''Bicester'' '''([[pennant number]] L34) was an [[destroyer escort|escort destroyer]] of the [[Hunt class destroyer#Type II|Type II Hunt class]]. The [[Royal Navy]] ordered ''Bicester''{{'}}s construction three months after the outbreak of the Second World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;navhisnet&quot;&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DE-Bicester.htm|title=HMS Bicester, Escort Destroyer | publisher=naval-history.net | accessdate=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hawthorn Leslie and Company|Hawthorn Leslie &amp; Co.]] laid down her keel at their [[River Tyne|Tyne]] yard on 29 May 1940, as Admiralty Job Number J4210. The ship was named after a [[fox hunt]] in [[Oxfordshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;navhisnet&quot; /&gt;

==Career==

===Early operations===
''Bicester'' began her contractor trials and commissioning in June, passing her acceptance trials on 16 June and beginning work-up procedures. On 26 June ''Bicester'' escorted [[George VI|King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] back to England after their visit to a naval base at [[Larne]], [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iwm&quot;&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205185784 |work=Imperial War Museum Collection Search |title=THE ROYAL NAVY DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR - A 10089 (photograph reference)| publisher=[[Imperial War Museum]]|accessdate= 2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, the destroyer completed her work-up, and joined the ''Londonderry Special Escort Force''. On 29 July ''Bicester'' joined military convoy WS21 in the [[The Clyde|Clyde]] with the destroyers {{HMS|Bramham|L51|2}}, {{HMS|Wilton|L128|2}}, {{HMS|Keppel|D84|2}} and {{HMS|Salisbury|I-52|2}} as the local escort for the convoy during its passage in the Northwestern Approaches.

In August, ''Bicester'' was nominated for detached escort service for a convoy [[Malta Convoys|aimed to relieve Malta]]. On 4 August ''Bicester'' detached from WS21, and joined the Malta relief convoy WS21S, which had set off from the Clyde to [[Gibraltar]] on 2 August as part of [[Operation Pedestal]]. The destroyer passed through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], and joined the escort for ships on 11 August while on passage through the [[Sicilian Narrows]] to Malta.&lt;ref name=&quot;uboat&quot;&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/4636.html|title=HMS Bicester, (L34) | publisher=uboat.net | accessdate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 August the convoy came under heavy submarine and air attack, during which the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}} was sunk. Further attacks by submarines sank and severely damaged both escorts and ships, with the result that ''Bicester'' had to be detached from the convoy along with {{HMS|Derwent|L83|2}} and ''Wilton'' to escort the damaged {{HMS|Nigeria|60|2}} back to Gibraltar. On 18 August ''Bicester'' was released from Operation Pedestal, and the destroyer took passage back to [[Derry]] to resume her escort duties, joining as local escort of military convoy WS22 on 28 August.

===Back to Gibraltar===

''Bicester'' detached from WS22 on 1 September, returning to Derry for further convoy escort duties, which included joining military convoy WS23 in the Clyde on 4 October. After detaching from WS23, ''Bicester'' returned for escort duties in Derry, and was nominated for the escort of military convoys to [[North Africa]] for [[Operation Torch|allied landings]] on 8 October. ''Bicester'' was deployed escorting the convoys to Gibraltar throughout November and December.
[[File:Destroyer Sinks U-boat Off North African Coast. 24 February 1943, Algiers. A14948.jpg|left|thumb|Crew of the ''Bicester'' at Algiers, following the sinking of a U-boat Off North African Coast, 24 February 1943 (IWM A14948)]]
In January 1943, ''Bicester'' was based at [[Algiers]] in continuation of her duties. In February, the destroyer was deployed with other Hunt-class destroyers for patrol and convoy escorting duties. On 17 February she took part in the search for the Italian submarine {{ship|Italian submarine|Asteria||2}} whilst defending a convoy. On 20 February ''Bicester'' was deployed with the destroyers {{HMS|Lamerton|L88|2}} and {{HMS|Wheatland|L122|2}} on their search for the German submarine, {{GS|U-443||2}}. ''Bicester'' took part in attacks on the German submarine, along with the other two destroyers and on 23 February, after a three-day search and destroy operation, the submarine was sunk by sustained depth charge attacks, with no survivors.&lt;ref name=&quot;uboat&quot; /&gt;

Between March and April, ''Bicester'' continued her convoy defence and patrol duties at Algiers. In May the destroyer took part in the blockade of the [[Cape Bon]] area in order [[Operation Retribution (1943)|to prevent the escape of Axis craft]]. On 9 May, during deployment with {{HMS|Oakley|L98|2}}, the destroyers found themselves under air attack by [[Spitfire|Spitfire aircraft]]; ''Bicester'' sustained major damage from a near miss, with the bomb exploding alongside causing major flooding and extensive damage. ''Bicester'' was taken in tow to Malta for temporary repairs, which were carried out in June. In July, the destroyer made a passage through to the United Kingdom for permanent repairs, which were carried out between August and September.

===Malta, Adriatic and Indian Ocean===

In October, ''Bicester'' was nominated for service in the 59th Destroyer Division, which was based in Malta, with the destroyer continuing her post repair trials. The destroyer made a passage to Malta in November, where she was deployed in the Adriatic and the central Mediterranean. On 2 December ''Bicester'' was damaged during an [[air raid on Bari]] when an ammunition ship was hit and exploded, spreading her cargo of [[sulfur mustard|mustard gas]] over the harbour and town. The destroyer {{HMS|Zetland|L59|2}} was also damaged, but less seriously. ''Zetland'' towed ''Bicester'' to [[Taranto]] for repairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;uboat&quot; /&gt; There were so many mustard gas casualties that, on arrival in Taranto, the ships had to ask for assistance to enter the harbour as all navigating officers had their vision impaired by this chemical weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Southern|first=George |date= 2002|title=Poisonous Inferno: WWII Tragedy at Bari Harbour |url= |location= |publisher=Airlife Publishing Ltd |pages= |isbn=184037389X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1944, the destroyer was under repair. These were completed on 15 January with a post repair trial and the resumption of convoy defence duty. ''Bicester'' was deployed for convoy escort duties in the central Mediterranean, and for support of military operations in the Adriatic between February and April. On 5 May ''Bicester'' bombarded the town of [[Ardea, Lazio|Ardea]] in support of shore operations. Between June and July, the destroyer was back in the Adriatic in the support and defence of convoys.&lt;ref name=&quot;navhisnet&quot; /&gt;

''Bicester'' joined US Navy ships on their passage to [[Naples]] in August 1944, forming part of the escort for Assault Convoy SM1 which was made up of three Royal Navy trawlers, and six US Navy minor warships. The destroyer detached from SM1 on 15 August upon arriving off the landing beachhead. After being released from [[Operation Dragoon]], ''Bicester'' returned to Royal Navy control in September, and was deployed in the Adriatic in the support of convoys, guerrilla attacks and other shore operations. Between October and November, ''Bicester'' formed close support of the reoccupation of a number of [[Aegean islands]], as well as convoy defence duties. During December and January, the destroyer was a [[Piraeus]] guardship, supporting and defending convoys, until she was rebased at Malta from where she was nominated for refit in [[Alexandria]].

The refit of ''Bicester'' began in March, and the destroyer was nominated for service in the Eighteenth Destroyer Flotilla of the Eastern Fleet. The destroyer made a passage to the United Kingdom, where she was taken-in-hand for refit in order to improve habitability in June, 1945. Upon completion of these works in July, the ship was recommissioned and the destroyer was ordered into the Indian Ocean to join the flotilla of the Eastern Fleet. In August ''Bicester'' arrived at [[Trincomalee]] before [[VJ Day]], and joined the flotilla. On 28 August the destroyer sailed from Trincomalee as part of escort for Convoy JMA2BS during her passage to assault a beachhead near [[Port Dickson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uboat&quot; /&gt;

===Post War Service===

''Bicester'' remained in the Eastern Fleet and became the Leader of 29th Destroyer Flotilla, based at [[Bombay]]. She was deployed for fleet duties until her return to the United Kingdom in November.

After her arrival at [[Sheerness]] on 12 December 1945 ''Bicester'' was deployed in the ''Nore Local Flotilla''. In 1947, the destroyer became the Leader of Flotilla, and was deployed for training and local duties (including her carrying the [[Olympic Flame]] across the [[English Channel]] in July 1948 for the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London) until January 1950 when she paid-off and was put in Reserve at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uboat&quot; /&gt;

Although brought forward to attend the Coronation Review in 1953, in which she took part&lt;ref&gt;Souvenir Programme, ''Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953'', HMSO, Gale and Polden&lt;/ref&gt; she was not recommissioned for operational service and was placed on the Disposal List in 1955. She was sold to [[Thos W Ward]] in 1956, and arrived in tow at the breakers yard in [[Thos W Ward]] Grays, Essex on 23 August 1956 for demolition.&lt;ref name=&quot;navhisnet&quot; /&gt;

'''USS ''Brant'' (AM-24)''' was a {{sclass|Lapwing|minesweeper||ship}} in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. She was named by the U.S. Navy for the [[Brant Goose|brant]], a small goose.

''Brant'' was launched 30 May 1918 by [[Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company|Sun Shipbuilding Co.]], [[Chester, Pennsylvania]]; sponsored by Miss Lois Graham; commissioned 5 September 1918, Lieutenant J. W. Stoakley in command; and reported to the Minesweeping Force, [[5th Naval District]], to sweep [[convoy]] courses off the coast of [[Virginia]].

== East Coast operations ==
[[File:USS Brant AM 24 Fleet Week (1940).jpg|200px|thumbnail|Postage Envelope Of Fleet Week In Early 1940s]]
She served as a [[Lightvessel|lightship]] off the [[Virginia]] coast in December 1918. In May 1919 she was placed under Director of Tugs, [[5th Naval District]], for towing and harbor operations at [[Norfolk]].

On 17 September 1919 ''Brant'' reported to Train, [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], at [[San Diego, California|San Diego]]. She remained on the [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] with the fleet until June 1941, serving as a [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]], target vessel, and fleet [[Tugboat|tug]], except for short periodic moves to the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Panama Canal]] area, and the [[Hawaiian Islands]] on fleet concentrations and exercises.

Assigned to the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]], ''Brant'' arrived at [[New York Navy Yard]] 1 August 1941 and commenced operations between [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Solomons Island, Maryland]], testing mines.

On 26 November 1941 ''Brant'' arrived at the Naval Operating Base, [[Naval Station Argentia|Argentia]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], where she carried out towing operations and picket and escort duty until June 1942. Between 10 and 13 February 1942 she aided the [[Norway|Norwegian]] steamer {{SS|Anderson}}, aground off [[Shots Cove]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], and transported her crew to Argentia. On 16 February she assisted the British [[Steamboat|steamer]] {{SS|Kitty's Brook}} off a shoal in [[Placentia Bay]]. Between 18 and 24 February she was on duty at [[Great St. Lawrence Harbor]] near the scene of the grounded {{USS|Pollux|AKS-2}} and {{USS|Truxton|DD-229}}. On 6 May she rescued the crew from the {{SS|Magnhild}} grounded on [[Virgin Rocks]].

== World War II Atlantic operations ==
On 29 June 1942 she arrived at [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] for an extensive overhaul. Her designation was changed to Ocean tug '''AT-132''' on 1 June 1942, and to rescue salvage ship '''ARS-32''' on 1 September 1942. On 6 November 1942 ''Brant'' departed the [[United States]] for the [[Mediterranean]] where she remained between 25 November 1942 and 16 December 1943 conducting salvage operations. During this time she operated at various ports in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy. She also participated in the Sicilian occupation (9–15 July 1943) and the [[Salerno]] landings (9–21 September 1943).

== Damaged by friendly fire off Sicily ==
USS ''Brant'' was accidentally damaged 10 August 1943, off [[Sicily]], when inadequate signals caused friendly naval forces to shell her.
''Brant'' was on a mission to locate a drifting LCT and left from Licata, Sicily in the regular convoy channel.

At 0100, the destroyer USS ''Benson'' fired two star shells and 15 service rounds at the ''Brant'' from greater than 4000 yards. Extensive fires occurred, but were immediately controlled. Ten of her crew were killed and 18 wounded. On the same day ''Brant'' steamed to Sicily and the ''Benson'' proceeded to Malta.  The formal inquest on 24 August 1943 in Bizerte, Tunisia stated the following Findings of Facts:
1. The moon had set and visibility was poor. (Glass range 3000 yards)
2. BRANT was not equipped with radar.
3. BRANT only knew BENSON was in area after star shell had burst.
4. BRANT used her aldis lamp to challenge BENSON because her 12-in lamp was immediately destroyed.
5. The BENSON used a blue signal lamp from 4500 yards. (Not visible until 2500 yards)
6. BRANT was in a regular convoy route.
7. BRANT damage was on main deck.
8. 5 known dead, 5 missing, 18 wounded.
9. BRANT used correct challenge under fire.
10.  Neither BRANT nor BENSON challenge lights were strong enough for visibility conditions.
11.  BRANT proceeded under own power to Bizerte
in Tunisia
12. BRANT was tied up to Large Repair Ship in Bizerte for extensive repairs.

== Normandy Invasion operations ==
Returning to the [[United States]] in January 1944, ''Brant'' underwent a yard overhaul at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], and then departed for [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], England, where she arrived 9 March 1944. She carried out salvage and towing operations at various ports in England and [[Scotland]] until June when she departed for the invasion of the [[Europe]]an continent. Between 6 and 19 June 1944 she furnished logistic support to ships participating in the [[invasion of Normandy]].

''Brant'' continued with her salvage duties in [[England|English]] and [[France|French]] waters until June 1945 when she proceeded to [[Bremerhaven, Germany]]. Remaining at Bremerhaven until 26 July 1945, she then sailed for the [[United States]], via [[Ireland]]. She arrived at [[New London, Connecticut]], 25 August 1945 and then steamed to [[New York City|New York]] where she remained moored until 4 October.

She was decommissioned 19 December 1945 at [[New York Navy Yard]] and transferred to the [[Maritime Commission]] 19 August 1946.

''Brant'' received three [[battle star]]s for her service in [[World War II]].

'''Operation Cottage''' was a [[Military tactics|tactical]] [[maneuver warfare|maneuver]] which completed the [[Aleutian Islands campaign]]. On August 15, 1943, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] military forces landed on [[Kiska Island]], which had been occupied by [[Japan]]ese forces since June, 1942. The Japanese, however, had secretly abandoned the island two weeks prior, and so the Allied landings were unopposed. Despite this, after over two days in thick fog and in a confused state of affairs, U.S. and Canadian forces mistook each other for the enemy. The brief firefight left 32 dead, with a further 50 wounded on either side and 130 [[trench foot]] wounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Battle for Kiska&quot;/&gt; Allied forces suffered over 300 casualties in total during the operation, due to stray Japanese [[Naval mine|mines]], [[friendly fire]] incidents, and the difficult terrain.

==Background==
{{Campaignbox Aleutians}}
{{main|Japanese occupation of Kiska}}
The Japanese under [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Takeji Ono]] had landed on Kiska at approximately 01:00 on June 7, 1942, with a force of about 500 [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Marines (military)|marines]]. Soon after arrival, they stormed an [[United States|American]] [[weather station]]. Here they killed two and captured eight [[United States Navy]] officers. The remaining eight were sent to Japan as [[prisoners of war]].
Another 2,000 Japanese troops arrived, landing in Kiska Harbor. At this time, [[Monzo Akiyama]], a [[Rear-Admiral]], headed the force on Kiska. In December 1942, additional anti-aircraft units, engineers, and a negligible number of reinforcement infantry arrived on the island. In the spring of 1943, control was transferred to [[Kiichiro Higuchi]].

==Invasion plan and execution==
[[File:Kiska Island 1943.svg|thumb|right|The Allied invasion of Kiska, August 17, 1943]]
A [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] aircraft sighted Japanese ships in Kiska. No further identification was visible. To United States naval planners, none was necessary and the orders to invade Kiska soon followed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Due to the heavy casualties suffered at [[Battle of Attu|Attu Island]], planners were expecting another costly operation. The Japanese tactical planners had, however, realized the isolated island was no longer defensible and planned for an evacuation.

Although small, there were signs of Japanese retreat. Anti-aircraft guns, once active during the bombardment of Kiska, were silent when Allied planes flew over in the days leading up to the invasion.

On August 15, 1943, the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Division]] (U.S.) and the 13th Infantry Brigade (Canada), landed on opposite shores of Kiska.

Both U.S. and Canadian forces mistook each other as the Japanese and, as a result of [[friendly fire]], 28 Americans and 4 Canadians were killed, with wounded on either side.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Battle for Kiska&quot;/&gt; 
A stray Japanese [[Naval mine|mine]] caused the {{USS|Abner Read|DD-526}} to lose a large chunk of its stern. The blast killed 71 and wounded 47. 191 troops went missing during the two-day stay on the island and presumably also died from friendly fire, booby traps, or environmental causes. Four other troops had also been killed by [[landmines]] or other [[Booby trap|trap]]s.

'''USS ''Dorado'' (SS-248)''', a [[Gato class submarine|''Gato''-class submarine]], was the first submarine of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for the dorado, also known as the [[dolphinfish]] or [[mahi-mahi]].

Her keel was laid down on 27 August 1942 by the [[Electric Boat]] Company of [[Groton, Connecticut]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 23 May 1943 (sponsored by Mrs. Ezra G. Allen), and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 28 August 1943, [[Lieutenant Commander]] Earle Caffrey Schneider in command.

==Service history==

''Dorado''{{'}}s sea trials proved the readiness of the crew, and she sailed from [[New London, Connecticut]], on 6 October 1943 for the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. She did not arrive.

The standard practice of imposing bombing restrictions within an area {{convert|50|nmi|km|abbr=on}} ahead, {{convert|100|nmi|km|abbr=on}} astern, and {{convert|15|nmi|km|abbr=on}} on each side of the scheduled position of an unescorted submarine making passage in friendly waters had been carried out and all concerned had been notified. However, the crew of a [[PBM Mariner]] of Patrol Squadron 210 out of [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba]], assigned to provide air coverage on the evening of 12 October had received an incorrect description of the restriction area, {{convert|11|nmi|km|abbr=on}} out of place.

At 2049 local time, under a moon-lit but stormy sky, that plane attacked an unidentified [[submarine]] that it believed was outside the restriction area with three Mark-47 [[depth charge]]s and a {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Mark-4 Mod-4 demolition bomb. About two hours later, the plane sighted a second [[submarine]] with which it attempted to exchange recognition signals. This second submarine fired upon the plane.

A convoy scheduled to pass through the restricted area surrounding ''Dorado'' on the evening of 12 October reported no contact.

Air searches were begun immediately after 14 October, her scheduled date of arrival. Widely scattered oil slicks with occasional debris were found. Subsequently the [[Board of Investigation]] held in Guantánamo Bay, and the more formal [[Naval Board of Inquiry]] held at the [[Washington Navy Yard]], found that the &quot;widely scattered oil slicks&quot; were actually oleous in nature and not [[bunker oil]] or fuel - most probably rotting vegetation like [[seaweed]]. All of the &quot;occasional debris&quot; was determined not to have come from ''Dorado''.

At both the Board of Investigation and the Court of Inquiry, the aircrew testified that they were certain that both submarines they had attacked were [[U-boat]]s. Despite the circumstantial evidence, there are reasons to doubt that ''Dorado'' was sunk by the Mariner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostsubs.com/Dorado.htm www.lostsubs.com - USS ''Dorado'' (SS-248)]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the crew knew that ''Dorado'' was operating in the area, they carefully observed their two targets before attacking.  Prior to the first attack, the four crewmen of the aircraft observed the surfaced submarine for 12 minutes, noting:

* it was {{convert|48|nmi|km|abbr=on}} from where they had been told to expect ''Dorado'' to be and {{convert|34|nmi|km|abbr=on}} from where ''Dorado'' really was supposed to be
* it was heading almost 90 degrees off from ''Dorado''’s base course
* it had no guns on the fore deck where ''Dorado'' carried a five-inch (127 mm) gun
* it had an entirely grooved deck where ''Dorado''{{'}}s deck was grooved only near the [[conning tower]]
* it had a &quot;knob-like&quot; object on the front of the [[conning tower]], almost certainly the [[Biscay Cross]] radar detector installed on [[Type IX U-boat]]s
[[File:RadarDetector_1.png|left|thumb|50px|'''FuMB-1 Metox'''-U-boat radar detector antenna, similar to the Biscay Cross.]]
Post-war examination of ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' records indicate that the submarine first attacked by the Mariner may have been {{GS|U-518||2}}, though that boat's logs do not record the attack. It is possible that the attack went unnoticed by the boat; of the three depth charges and one 100-pound bomb that were dropped, one depth charge was a confirmed dud, one was dropped too low to arm, and neither the third depth charge nor the bomb were seen to explode. After the attack, the Mariner searched the area for 20 minutes, but saw no explosions, bubbles, or debris.

The second submarine, attacked by the Mariner two hours later, was certainly {{GS|U-214|2}}; her log book, captured after [[World War II]], describes firing at the aircraft.

On 8 October, five miles off [[Colón, Panama|Colón]], ''U-214'' laid a minefield of 15 mines. One of these may have sunk the USS Dorado on or about 14 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_4223.html |title=Patrol of U-boat U-214 from 22 Aug 1943 to 30 Nov 1943 - U-boat patrols - uboat.net |publisher=uboat.net |accessdate=2009-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/3108.html |title=USS Dorado (SS-248) - American Vessels lost to U-boats - uboat.net |publisher=uboat.net |accessdate=2011-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A memorial to ''Dorado'' has been constructed in the Veterans Memorial Park in [[Wichita, Kansas]] on the [[Arkansas River]].

{{Campaignbox Normandy}}

'''Exercise Tiger''', or '''Operation Tiger''', was the code name for one in a series of large-scale [[Operation_Overlord#Rehearsals_and_security|rehearsals]] for the [[Operation Overlord|D-Day]] invasion of [[Normandy]], which took place in April 1944 on [[Slapton, Devon|Slapton Sands]] in [[Devon]]. Coordination and communication problems resulted in [[friendly fire]] deaths during the exercise, and an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] convoy positioning itself for the [[Amphibious warfare|landing]] was attacked by [[E-boat]]s of [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', resulting in the deaths of at least 749 American servicemen.&lt;ref name=MacDonald-SS-1988-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenton 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1460267/The-disaster-that-could-have-scuppered-Overlord.html|title=The disaster that could have scuppered Overlord|last=Fenton|first=Ben|date=26 April 2004|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the impending invasion of Normandy, the incident was under the strictest secrecy at the time and was only nominally reported afterward.

==Exercise==
===Landing operations===
In late 1943, as part of the build-up to D-day, the British government set up a training ground at Slapton Sands, Devon, to be used by Force &quot;U&quot;, the American forces tasked with landing on [[Utah Beach]]. Slapton Beach was selected for its similarity to Utah Beach: a gravel beach, followed by a strip of land and then a lake. Approximately 3,000 local residents in the area of [[Slapton, Devon|Slapton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exeterflotilla.org/history_misc/sth_dvn_evac/index.html |title=South Devon Evacuation 1944 |publisher=Exeterflotilla.org |date=16 November 1943|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; now [[South Hams|South Hams District]] of [[Devon]], were evacuated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/environment/historic_environment/slapton-line/sl-monument_rededication.htm?textsize=1 |title=Slapton Line: Slapton Monument Rededication |publisher=Devon County Council |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some had never left their villages before being evacuated.&lt;ref name=stokes&gt;{{cite news |last=Stokes |first=Paul |title=Veterans honour 749 who died in D-Day rehearsal |work=[[The Daily Telegraph ]] |location=London |date=29 April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landing exercises started in December 1943. Exercise Tiger was one of the larger exercises that took place in April and May 1944. The exercise was to last from 22 April until 30 April 1944, and covered all aspects of the invasion, culminating in a beach landing at Slapton Sands. On board nine large [[tank landing ship]]s (LSTs), the 30,000 troops prepared for their mock landing, which also included a live-firing exercise.

Protection for the exercise area came from the [[Royal Navy]]. Two [[destroyer]]s, three [[Motor Torpedo Boat]]s and two [[Motor Gun Boat]]s patrolled the entrance to [[Lyme Bay]] and Motor Torpedo Boats watched the [[Cherbourg]] area where [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[E-boat]]s were based.

The first phase of the exercise focused on marshalling and embarkation drills, and lasted from 22 to 25 April. On the evening of 26 April the first wave of assault troops boarded their transports and set off, the plan being to simulate the Channel crossing by taking a roundabout route through Lyme Bay, in order to arrive off Slapton at first light on 27 April.

===Friendly fire incident===
The first practice assault took place on the morning of 27 April&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Dear |first1=Ian |last2=Foot |first2=M.R.D. |authorlink2=M. R. D. Foot |title = The Oxford companion to World War II |publisher = Oxford University Press |location=New York |year = 2001|isbn = 0-19-860446-7 |page = 787}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Herman|first = Jan K|title = Battle Station Sick Bay: Navy Medicine in World War II|publisher = Naval Institute Press|year = 1997|isbn = 1-55750-361-3|location = Annapolis |page = 191}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was marred by an incident involving [[friendly fire]]. [[H-hour]] was set for 07:30, and was to be include live ammunition to acclimatize the troops to the sights, sounds and even smells of a naval bombardment. During the landing itself, live rounds were to be fired over the heads of the incoming troops by forces on land, for the same reason. This followed an order made by General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the Supreme Allied Commander, who felt that the men must be hardened by exposure to real battle conditions.&lt;ref name=Small&gt;{{cite book|last1=Small|first1=Ken|last2=Rogerson|first2=Mark|title=The Forgotten Dead – Why 946 American Servicemen Died Off The Coast Of Devon In 1944 – And The Man Who Discovered Their True Story|year=1988|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=0-7475-0309-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exercise was to include naval bombardment by ships of [[List of ships of Force U Bombardment Group|Force U Bombardment Group]] fifty minutes prior to the landing.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=252}}

Several of the landing ships for that morning were delayed, and the officer in charge, American Admiral [[Don P. Moon]], decided to delay H-hour for 60 minutes, until 08:30.&lt;ref name=Small /&gt; Some of the landing craft did not receive word of the change. Landing on the beach at their original scheduled time, the second wave came under fire, suffering an unknown number of casualties. Rumours circulated along the fleet that as many as 450 men were killed.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=254}}

On the day after the first practice assaults, early on the morning of 28 April, the exercise was blighted when Convoy T-4, consisting of eight LSTs carrying vehicles and combat engineers of the [[Engineer Special Brigade#1st Engineer Special Brigade|1st Engineer Special Brigade]], was attacked by nine German E-boats under the command of ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' [[Bernd Klug]], in [[Lyme Bay]].

Of the two ships assigned to protect the convoy, only one was present. {{HMS|Azalea|K25|6}}, a [[corvette]] was leading the LSTs in a straight line, a formation that later drew criticism since it presented an easy target to the E-boats. The second ship that was supposed to be present, [[HMS Scimitar (H21)|HMS ''Scimitar'']], a [[World War I]] destroyer, had been in collision with an LST, suffered structural damage and left the convoy to be repaired at [[Plymouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mason|first=Geoffrey B.|url=http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-05S-Scimitar.htm|title=HMS Scimitar, destroyer|year=2003|publisher=Naval History.net|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the LSTs and British naval headquarters were operating on different frequencies, the American forces did not know this.&lt;ref name=Small /&gt; {{HMS|Saladin|H54|6}} was dispatched as a replacement, but did not arrive in time to help protect the convoy.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=75}}

The E-boats had left Cherbourg on patrol the previous evening and did not encounter the Allied patrol lines off Cherbourg or in the [[English Channel]]. They spotted the convoy  attacked.{{efn|One of these E-Boats was S-130, now in [[dry dock]] in [[Plymouth, Devon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmpt.org.uk/boats/S130/index1.htm |title=Schnellboot S130 |publisher=British Military Powerboat Team |date=7 November 2004 |accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Casualties==
*{{USS|LST-289||2}} was set on fire but eventually made it back to shore with the loss of 123 Navy personnel.
*{{USS|LST-507||2}} was torpedoed and sunk with the loss of 202 US Army/US Navy personnel.
*{{USS|LST-511||2}} was damaged by [[friendly fire]].
*{{USS|LST-531||2}} sank within six minutes of being torpedoed with the loss of 424 Army and Navy personnel.&lt;ref name=MacDonald-SS-1988-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenton 2004&quot;/&gt;

The remaining ships and their escort fired back and the E-boats made no more attacks.  In total, 749 servicemen (551 [[United States Army]] and 198 [[United States Navy]]) were killed during Exercise Tiger,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenton 2004&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=227}} whereas only 197 were killed in the actual [[Utah Beach]] landing on 6 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Whitmarsh | first = Andrew | title = D-Day in Photographs | year = 2009 | publisher = History Press | location = Stroud | isbn = 978-0-7524-5095-7 | page = 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many servicemen drowned or died of [[hypothermia]] in the cold sea while waiting to be rescued. Many were not shown how to put on their lifebelt correctly, and placed it around their waist, the only available spot because of their large backpacks. In some cases this meant that when they jumped into the water the weight of their combat packs flipped them upside down, dragging their heads underwater and drowning them.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=64, 114–115}}  Dale Rodman, who travelled on ''LST-507'', commented &quot;The worst memory I have is setting off in the lifeboat away from the sinking ship and watching bodies float by.&quot; &lt;ref name=stokes /&gt; The 248 bodies that were recovered were sent to [[Brookwood Cemetery]] in Surrey on 29 April.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=237}}

==Aftermath==
As a result of official embarrassment and concerns over possible leaks just prior to the real invasion, all survivors were sworn to secrecy by their superiors. Ten missing officers involved in the exercise had [[BIGOT list|BIGOT]]-level clearance for [[D-Day]], meaning that they knew the invasion plans and could have compromised the invasion should they have been captured alive. As a result, the invasion was nearly called off until the bodies of all ten victims were found.&lt;ref name=Small /&gt;

There is little information about exactly how individual soldiers and sailors died. The US Department of Defense stated in 1988 that record keeping may have been inadequate aboard some of the ships, and the most pertinent log books were lost at sea.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=220}} A ninth LST ([[USS LST-508|''LST-508'']]) was scheduled to be in the convoy, but was damaged. Author Nigel Lewis speculates that some or all of its infantrymen may have been aboard ''LST 507'' when it went down.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=232–233}} Various eyewitness accounts detail hasty treatment of casualties and rumors circulated of unmarked mass graves in Devon fields.&lt;ref name=Small /&gt;

Several changes resulted from mistakes made in Exercise Tiger:
* Radio frequencies were standardised; the British escort vessels were late and out of position due to radio problems, and a signal of the E-boats' presence was not picked up by the LSTs.
* Better [[lifejacket|life vest]] training for landing troops
* New plans for small craft to pick up floating survivors on D-Day

Official histories contain little information about the tragedy. Some commentators have called it a [[cover-up]], but the initial critical secrecy about Tiger may have merely resulted in longer-term quietude. In his book ''The Forgotten Dead: Why 946 American Servicemen Died Off The Coast Of Devon In 1944 – And The Man Who Discovered Their True Story'', published in 1988, Ken Small declares that the event &quot;was never covered up; it was 'conveniently forgotten'&quot;.&lt;ref name=Small /&gt; The casualty statistics from Tiger were not released by [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) until August 1944, along with the casualties of the actual D-Day landings. This report stated that there were 442 army dead and 197 navy, for a total of 639.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=228}} (However, Moon had reported on 30 April that there were 749 dead.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=227}}) [[Charles B. MacDonald]], author and former deputy chief historian at the [[U.S. Army Center of Military History]], notes that information from the SHAEF press release appeared in the August issue of ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]''.&lt;ref name=MacDonald-SS-1988-06&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacDonald |first=Charles B. |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/s/slapton-sands-the-cover-up-that-never-was.html |title=Slapton Sands: The 'Cover Up' That Never Was |journal=Army |volume=38 |issue=6 |publisher=[[Naval Historical Center]] |date=June 1988 |pages=64–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald surmises that the press release went largely unnoticed in light of the larger events that were occurring at the time.&lt;ref name=MacDonald-SS-1988-06 /&gt; The story was detailed in at least three books at the end of the war, including Captain Harry C. Butcher's ''My Three Years With Eisenhower'' (1946),&lt;ref name=Butcher&gt;{{cite book |last=Butcher |first=Harry C. |authorlink=Harry C. Butcher |title=My Three Years with Eisenhower: The Personal Diary of Captain Harry C. Butcher, USNR, Naval Aide to General Eisenhower, 1942 to 1945 |pp=528, 535}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in several publications and speeches.&lt;ref name=MacDonald-SS-1988-06 /&gt; Gordon A. Harrison mentioned it in the official Army history ''Cross-Channel Attack'' (p.&amp;nbsp;270) and [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] discussed it in his official Navy history, ''US Naval Operations, vol. 11'', p.&amp;nbsp;66.

With little or no support from the American or British armed forces for any venture to recover remains or dedicate a memorial to the incident, Devon resident and civilian Ken Small took on the task of seeking to commemorate the event, after discovering evidence of the aftermath washed up on the shore while [[beachcombing]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=bbcMay2014&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Claire |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-27185893 |title=The D-Day rehearsal that cost 800 lives |publisher=[[BBC News online]] |date=30 May 2014 |accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Small bought from the U.S. Government the rights to a submerged tank from the [[70th Tank Battalion (United States)|70th Tank Battalion]] discovered by his search efforts. In 1984, with the aid of local residents and diving firms, he raised the tank, which now stands as a memorial to the incident. The local authority provided a [[plinth]] on the seafront to put the tank on, and erected a plaque in memory of the men killed. Ken Small documents how the local villagers were of more assistance than either the US or UK military officials. Later the American military honoured and supported him, when at the same time the UK military were snubbing his efforts. Small died of cancer in March 2004, a few weeks before the 60th anniversary of the Exercise Tiger incident.

In 2006, the Slapton Sands Memorial Tank Limited (a non-profit organisation, one of whose directors is Small's son Dean) established a more prominent memorial listing the names of all the victims of the attacks on Exercise Tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Casson |first=John |url=http://www.exercisetigerslapton.org/exercise-tiger/roll-of-honour/ |title=Exercise Tiger Remembered |accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, a plaque memorialising the tragedy was erected at Utah Beach, Normandy, on the wall of a former German anti-aircraft bunker.

An M4 Sherman tank stands as a memorial to Exercise Tiger at Fort Rodman Park in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]].

In 1997, the Exercise Tiger Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exercisetiger.org/exercise-tiger-memorials.html |title=Memorials to Exercise Tiger |publisher=Exercise Tiger Association |accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; established a memorial to Exercise Tiger veterans in [[Mexico, Missouri]]. It is a 5,000-pound stern anchor from an LST of the Suffolk County Class on permanent loan from the Navy.

'''USS ''Extractor'' ARS-15''' was an [[Anchor class rescue and salvage ship|''Anchor''-class]] [[rescue and salvage ship]] of the [[United States Navy]] in [[World War II]]. 

''Extractor'' was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] by Colberg Boat Works, [[Stockton, California]], on 15 June 1943 (sponsored by Mrs. Lowden Jessup), and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 3 March 1944, Lieutenant (junior grade) L.&amp;nbsp;C. Oaks in command.

==Service history==
''Extractor'' sailed from [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] on 8 May 1944 en route to [[Eniwetok]] where she reported to Commander Service Squadron 2 (ServRon&amp;nbsp;2) for salvage and rescue duty. During the summer of 1944 she executed repairs, diving, and towing as well as salvage operations from [[Pearl Harbor]] to Eniwetok and [[Ulithi]]. On 20 November while at Ulithi she fought valiantly though futilely against fire on board {{USS|Mississinewa|AO-59}} which capsized and sank.

On 3 December 1944 she steamed to [[Guam]], reporting for duty with Service Squadron 12 (ServRon&amp;nbsp;12), with which she served until 21 January 1945 when she departed unescorted for the [[Philippines|Philippine]] area. She was underway on the morning of 24 January when, through mistaken identification by {{USS|Guardfish|SS-217}}, the latter fired a [[torpedo]] which struck ''Extractor'''s starboard side. The salvage ship capsized and sank at {{coord|15|44|N|135|29|E}}, within 5 minutes. Six lives were lost, but the remainder of her crew were rescued by ''Guardfish''.

'''HMS ''Hussar''''' was a [[Royal Navy]] [[Halcyon-class minesweeper]] of [[World War II]].

As the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies advanced following the [[invasion of Normandy]], ''Hussar'', {{HMS|Britomart|J22|2}}, {{HMS|Jason|J99|2}} and {{HMS|Salamander|J86|2}} were assigned to the 1st Minesweeping Flotilla (1MF) clearing [[Axis powers|Axis]] minefields north of Normandy to open additional ports to supply the advance. On the afternoon of 27 August 1944, they were sweeping off [[La Poterie-Cap-d'Antifer|Cap d'Antifer]] in preparation for the battleship {{HMS|Warspite|03|2}} and monitors {{HMS|Erebus|I02|2}} and {{HMS|Roberts|F40|2}} to engage [[Le Havre]] [[coastal artillery]] delaying the advance of Canadian troops.&lt;ref name=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halcyon-class.co.uk/FriendlyFire/friendly_fire.htm|title=SINKING OF HMS BRITOMART AND HMS HUSSAR BY FRIENDLY FIRE |publisher=Halcyon Class|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headquarters officer assigning the minesweeping project to 1MF neglected to inform the Flag Officer British Assault Area ([[James Rivett-Carnac (Royal Navy officer)|Rear‑Admiral Rivett‑Carnac]]), who was responsible for defending the invasion beaches from [[E-boat]]s operating out of Le Havre. 1MF was observed on a southwesterly leg of the minesweeping operation and assumed to be German ships proceeding to attack Allied shipping off the invasion beaches. The Admiral's staff requested [[No. 263 Squadron RAF]] and [[No. 266 Squadron RAF]] to attack the presumed enemy ships. The squadrons responded with 16 [[Hawker Typhoon|Typhoons]] armed with [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|20 mm cannon]] and [[High Explosive]] [[RP-3|&quot;60 lb&quot; RP-3 unguided rockets]]. [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilots identified 1MF as apparently friendly shipping, but upon questioning their orders were told the [[Royal Navy]] had no ships in the area.&lt;ref name=web/&gt;

In a well-executed attack out of the sun at 13:30, the Typhoons sank ''Hussar'' and ''Britomart''; and ''Salamander'' was damaged far beyond economical repair and written off as a constructive total loss. Eighty-six British sailors were killed and 124 more were injured. 1MF identified the Typhoons as friendly, and poor visibility into the sun prevented early recognition of the impending &quot;[[friendly fire]]&quot;. ''Jason'' established radio contact to terminate the attack.&lt;ref name=web/&gt;

'''HMS ''Jason''''' was a {{sclass|Halcyon|minesweeper||ship}}.  She was named after the [[Jason|hero in Greek mythology]] and was the sixteenth (and {{as of|2008|lc=on}}, the final) [[Royal Navy]] ship to carry the name ''Jason''.  She was laid down on 12 December 1936, launched on 6 October 1937, and was completed on 9 June 1938.  She survived the  [[Second World War]] and was sold in 1946 to become a cargo ship.  She was eventually broken up in 1950.  Her [[pennant number]] was originally N99, but was changed to J99 in May 1940.

==Pre-war Duties==
Before the war, HMS ''Jason'' carried out surveys of the [[English Channel|English]] and [[Bristol Channel|Bristol]] Channels.  She carried out two principal surveys during 1938 and 1939.  She was unarmed until the outbreak of the Second World War.

==World War II==

===Home Waters===
Although HMS ''Jason'' had been designed as a [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]], in September 1939, she was converted into an antisubmarine vessel and assigned to 1st Anti-submarine striking force at [[Belfast]].  Her first minor damage sustained was on 12 October when she was grounded at Row Point.  Repairs were completed by 17 October and she was deployed in home waters for convoy defence, but she put in for more repairs on 3 August 1940, this time because of problems in her boilers.

After the repairs, she was again deployed to convoy defence, this time in the North West Approaches, during which she came under repeated attack from German [[U-boat]]s {{GS|U-32|1937|2}} and {{GS|U-28|1936|2}}.  Although HMS ''Jason'' was not damaged in the attacks, four merchant ships were lost and ''Jason'' picked up 18 survivors.  After one month in that role, yet more repairs were needed after a collision with the rescue tug ''Scheldt'', in which significant structural damage to her stem was sustained.  This time repairs were completed at [[Rosyth Dockyard|HM Dockyard]], [[Rosyth]], and she was, upon release, deployed to the Rosyth Escort Force to defend shipping to and from [[River Clyde|Clyde]].

As part of the Rosyth Escort Force, she was again subject to U-boat attack in October whilst escorting [[Convoy HX 79]] (totalling 49 ships) off [[Rockall]].  This was part of the most vicious U-boat attacks of the war, with ten ships being lost from [[Convoy HX 79]] alone.  HMS ''Jason'', however, was undamaged and picked up 78 survivors on 19 October and a further 111 survivors on the 20 October. None of the eight attacking submarines were sunk.

After this, ''Jason'' was primarily assigned to an anti-air role, and the number of AA guns was increased ''c''.1941.  On several occasions in early 1941, she was required to use this extra armament to fend off attacks from German aircraft.  No ship was damaged in any of these attacks, sometimes as a direct result of ''Jason'''s anti-aircraft fire.

She was once again put in for repair on 21 July 1941 at [[Leith]], after which she escorted more convoys through quieter times.  In mid-1942, she yet again put in for repair and re-fit which, together with trials, lasted until early 1943.  Part of the re-fit was in preparation for her new assignment, which was to operate in [[Arctic]] waters with ships of the [[Soviet Union]].

===Soviet Waters===
Her first assignment in this new rôle was to escort [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic Convoy]] [[Convoy JW 53|JW-53]] to [[Murmansk]] on 15 February.  Things did not start well, with several ships unable to even begin the journey.  The convoy encountered terrible weather from the start, some of the worst experienced by any of the Russian convoys.  HMS ''Jason'' was the lead ship and under command of Cdr. H.G.A. Lewis.  Lewis did a remarkable job of keeping order in the confusion which saw several ships damaged.  {{HMS|Sheffield|C24|6}} had the armour plating torn from one of her turrets by the heavy seas on the first day. The visibility was so poor that it was rarely clear how many ships were keeping up with the convoy, and communication was always troublesome.

On the third day, the escort trawler {{HMS|Lord Middleton|FY219|6}} suffered flooding and was forced to retreat to [[Scapa Flow]], another escort, {{HMS|Dianella|K07|6}}, also left the convoy to escort ''Lord Middleton''.  Also that day, the trawler ''Komiles'' suffered damage and was forced to retreat to the [[Faroe Islands|Faeroe Islands]].  An SOS signal was received from ''Komiles'' two days later as she had suffered hull damage in the storm.

The next day brought yet more chaos.  Heavy seas made visual communication almost impossible, and ''Jason'' was damaged by the weather and forced to carry out repairs to the ventilation trunking.  By the afternoon, only 22 ships were left in the convoy, the others having retreated.  Over the next few days, more [[destroyer]]s and [[corvette]]s joined the escort but {{HMS|Pytchley|L92|6}} and {{HMS|Middleton|L74|6}} left for Seydisfjord, Iceland to refuel.

The weather started to clear on the 23 February, but German aircraft sighted the convoy and one day later it was attacked by {{GS|U-255||2}} and {{GS|U-622||2}}. The escorts managed to defend the convoy and no ships were damaged. Air attacks from 21 [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju-88s]] followed over the next two days, but were again prevented by the escort from causing any damaging to the convoy.

On  26 February, Soviet destroyers joined the escort and it arrived at the [[Kola Peninsula|Kola Inlet]] in [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk]] the following day with only 15 ships making it to the Soviet port.

Along with {{HMS|Britomart|J22|6}}, HMS ''Jason'' was stationed in North Russia for the next few months as a minesweeper and patrol. Throughout this period, they were under constant air attack, but neither suffered any significant damage (two bombs hit HMS ''Britomart'' and skidded along the deck, but neither exploded).  It was noted that standards of the crew had dropped significantly since operation in Soviet waters, but both ships performed so well that the Russians offered to buy them. On 1 November 1943, she joined [[Convoy RA 54]] as an escort and returned to the [[United Kingdom]].

===Normandy Landings===
[[Image:HMS Britomart.jpg|thumb|180px|right|HMS ''Britomart'' was the leader of the 1st Minesweeping Flotilla from 7 March 1944]]
From 22 November 1943 through to early 1944, she was going under another extensive re-fit at [[HMNB Portsmouth]].  On completion of the re-fit she was nominated to join the newly formed 1st Minesweeping Flotilla, along with HMS [[HMS Britomart (J22)|''Britomart'']], [[HMS Gleaner (J83)|''Gleaner'']], [[HMS Halcyon (J42)|''Halcyon'']], [[HMS Harrier (J71)|''Harrier'']], [[HMS Hussar (J82)|''Hussar'']], [[HMS Salamander (J86)|''Salamander'']], [[HMS Seagull (J85)|''Seagull'']] and [[HMS Speedwell (J87)|''Speedwell'']].

Throughout February and March they carried out their duties in the North Sea, and were subsequently nominated for a support rôle during the [[Normandy Landings]].

Prior to the landings, ''Jason'' was assigned to sweep channel 9 in front of the landing parties, no mines were discovered, but coastal batteries fired upon her.  She continued in support for the next few days, as well as providing an escort for her flagship, [[HMS Scylla (98)|HMS ''Scylla'']].  On 18 June, she was involved in a collision which caused significant damage and flooding, and so she was required to retire to Portsmouth for repairs.

===Post-invasion Minesweeping Duties===
She resumed her service in the 1st Minesweeping Flotilla in August after her re-fit.  They were now operating out of Mulberry Harbour at [[Arromanches-les-Bains|Arromanches]], with instructions to keep the channel between there and Portsmouth clear of mines.

On 22 August they were deployed to clear a magnetic minefield off [[La Poterie-Cap-d'Antifer|Cap d'Antifer]] in preparation for HMS [[HMS Warspite (03)|''Warspite'']], [[HMS Erebus (I02)|''Erebus'']] and [[HMS Roberts (F40)|''Roberts'']] to move in and bombard enemy positions at [[Le Havre]].  On 26 August, they were ordered back to their previous rôle between Arromanches and Portsmouth, but upon a specific request from Commander Crick of HMS ''Jason'', who noted that the Cap d'Antifer area was not yet safe, they were allowed to remain in the area for another day and complete the task.

====Friendly Fire Incident====

| style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; |
&quot;Suddenly there were explosions and action stations sounded. My action station was the flag deck below the bridge. When I came on deck, I saw one ship listing badly, the crew abandoning ship. As I approached the ladder to the bridge, I saw two spitfires heading for the ship at sea level. The first one opened fire on the ship. I dived behind a locker.&quot;

:Although this was the responsible request of a mindful commander, and although the continuation of operations off Cap d'Antifer were official, it would end in disaster the following day when a flag officer failed to advise all concerned with air operations of the approval to extend minesweeping operations in the area.

:''Jason'' was leading the 1st Minesweeping Flotilla in sweeping operations when, at about noon, an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] reconnaissance aircraft flew over low, the pilot returning the waves from the ships' companies.  Yet about ninety minutes later, 16 RAF rocket-firing [[Hawker Typhoon|Typhoons]], of 263 and 266 Squadrons operating from [[Caen]], accompanied by a Polish squadron of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]], swooped out of the sun and attacked HMS ''Britomart'', they then returned for a second attack, hitting HMS ''Hussar'' and ''Salamander''.  Many of the seamen from the two ships were now in the water being shelled by German shore batteries.  As a result of this [[friendly fire]] disaster, HMS ''Britomart'' and ''Hussar'' were sunk and ''Salamander'' was a useless wreck floating on the calm water.  HMS ''Jason'' was damaged but not destroyed and started to rescue survivors.  She also deployed a smoke screen to hinder German shore batteries and took HMS ''Salamander'' on tow.  The ship was saved from sinking, but was damaged beyond repair.  Soon, other ships in the area assisted in the rescue of stricken seamen.  [[HMS Gozo (J287)|HMS ''Gozo'']] and ships of the 6th Minesweeping Flotilla were in the area preparing to join up with HMS ''Jason'' and witnessed the attack.

{| class=&quot;toccolours&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:23em; max-width: 25%;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;
| style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; |
&quot;It is felt that the fury and ferocity of concerted attacks by a number of Typhoon aircraft armed with rockets and cannons is an ordeal that has to be endured to be truly appreciated.&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; | A/Cdr. Trevor Crick of HMS ''Jason''
|}
:In total, 117 Royal Navy men were killed and 149 wounded, many seriously.  It was the most severe attack endured by any ships during [[Normandy Landings|''Operation Neptune'']] and as a result, the commander of HMS ''Jason'', Acting Commander Trevor Crick, was granted the military [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for his &quot;coolness, courage and devotion to duty&quot;.  Four other ship commanders were made MBEs, including Lieutenant John Sulman of [[HMS Colsay (T384)|HMS ''Colsay'']], who was injured in the back during the incident.  The RAF was exonerated, but Acting Commander D N Venables DSC, was severely reprimanded for negligence in not making sure the Flag Officer British Assault Area was informed of the change of order.

HMS ''Jason'' was then put in for repair at Portsmouth.  It would be a month before she returned to active duty.  For the last two months of 1944, she operated out of [[Ostend]] sweeping off the Belgium coast.  In January 1945, the 1st Minesweeping Flotilla was reassigned to [[Harwich]] to counter mining efforts by German [[E-boats]] and [[K-Verband|midget submarines]].  In February, HMS ''Jason'' was nominated for re-fit in [[London]].

In April 1945, she rejoined the 1st Minesweeping Flotilla at Harwich and continued minesweeping in the [[North Sea]].  It was one task that was not completed as soon as [[Victory in Europe Day|VE-Day]] dawned, and she continued in this capacity until a serious collision in the North Sea with [[HMS Hazard (J02)|HMS ''Hazard'']] caused serious structural damage, forcing a return to Portsmouth for repairs.  After repairs, she was again sent to continue clearing mines in the North Sea.

==Cargo Vessel==
She was sold to Wheelock Marden &amp; Co. on 3 September 1946, renamed '''''Jaslock''''' and converted into a cargo vessel.  This career did not last long and she was broken up in 1950.

'''ORP ''Jastrząb'''''&lt;ref group=note&gt;ORP stands for [[Okręt Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej]]&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;Hawk&quot;) was an old Holland-type [[United States S-class submarine|S-class]]  [[submarine]], originally of the [[United States Navy]], in Polish service between 1941 and 1942, when she was lost to [[friendly fire]].

==Ship history==
[[File:USS S-25 (SS-130) - 2.jpg|thumb|left|USS ''S-25'' about 1923/1924]]
She was laid down in October 1918 as {{USS|S-25|SS-130|6}}, and launched in 1922. In 1940 she was set aside as a training vessel, and then earmarked for transfer to the [[Royal Navy]] under [[Lend-Lease]].

She was decommissioned from the U.S. Navy on 4 November 1941, and simultaneously transferred to the Royal Navy as '''HMS ''P551'''''; shortly thereafter she was loaned to the [[Polish government-in-exile|exiled Polish government]], and entered service with the [[Polish Navy]] under Lieutenant Commander [[Bolesław Romanowski]], due to a lack of trained submarine crews in the Royal Navy at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Pertek, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=January 2016}}

''Jastrząb'' entered the history of the Polish Navy as its only submarine ever to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the West to the East, as she came from the US to Europe.

During the passage of convoy [[Convoy PQ 15|PQ-15]] to [[Murmansk]], ''Jastrząb'' on 2 May 1942 was mistakenly engaged by the [[destroyer]] {{HNoMS|St. Albans|I15|6}} and the [[minesweeper]] {{HMS|Seagull|J85|6}}. She was attacked with depth charges and made to surface, there she was strafed with the loss of five crew (including British [[liaison officer]]) and six injured, including the commander.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Pertek, p.324&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was badly damaged and had to be [[Scuttling|scuttled]], near {{coord|71|30|N|12|32|E|display=inline,title}}.

The incident is a matter of some controversy. One source &lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Pertek, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; states ''Jastrząb'' was escorting PQ 15, i.e. travelling with the convoy. Others however &lt;ref&gt;Paul Kemp, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Schofield, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; state she was covering PQ 15’s passage by patrolling the Norwegian coast against a sortie by German capital ships, one of five submarines so assigned. These sources state ''Jastrząb'' was out of position; Pertek however states that it was the convoy which was out of position,&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Pertek, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; and other sources confirm the convoy had altered course to avoid ice. The position of the incident, 200 miles from the Norwegian coast is inconsistent with a mission to patrol that coast, typically no more than 10 to 20 miles out.
 
Pertek also (after Romanowski's testimony) states ''Jastrząb'' was fired upon despite showing yellow recognition smoke candles; however other sources do not confirm this. Finally Pertek states the commanders of ''St Albans'' and ''Seagull'' were found guilty at a court martial over the incident; Kemp states that the court of enquiry (a normal procedure following the loss of a ship, though not of friendly fire cases) found no blame could be attributed to either commander.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kemp, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; It is not possible to reconcile these accounts.

On 5 May 1942, the convoy reached Murmansk, where the Polish crew remained resting for two and a half months, then returned to Great Britain on board the Polish destroyer {{ORP|Garland}}.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Pertek, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''McCawley'' (APA-4)''' was a {{sclass-|McCawley|attack transport}} that served with the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. Named after [[Charles Grymes McCawley|Charles G. McCawley]], eighth [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] of the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], she was the [[lead ship]] in her class.

The second ''McCawley'', formerly SS ''Santa Barbara'', was completed in 1928 by the [[Furness Shipbuilding Company]] of [[Haverton Hill|Haverton Hill-on-Tees]], [[England]]; acquired by the Navy from [[Grace Lines]] 26 July 1940; renamed ''McCawley'' (AP-10) 29 July 1940. The ship was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 11 September 1940, Capt. H. D. McHenry in command. She was reclassified an attack transport, APA-4, on 1 February 1943.

==Service history==
On 19 February 1942, ''McCawley'' got underway for [[Iceland]] with troops embarked. She returned to [[New York City|New York]] 25 March and then steamed to [[Norfolk, Virginia]] en route a new assignment with the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Fleet.

Transiting the Panama Canal 18 April, she discharged [[United States Marine Corps|marine]] [[aviator]]s at [[Pago Pago]] 8 May and continued on to [[Wellington|Wellington, New Zealand]]. Joining Amphibious Force, [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|South Pacific]], she became the [[flagship]] for Rear Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner|R. K. Turner]] shortly before the first [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] counter invasion of the war, [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]].

===Invasion of Guadalcanal===
On 7 August, the campaign started; at 0800 landings were made at [[Tulagi]], at 0919 on [[Lunga Point]], Guadalcanal. Air raids commenced on 8 August; ''McCawley'''s guns scored their first kills, destroying three, possibly four planes.

====Supply missions amid naval battles====
On 9 August, she witnessed the flares of the [[Battle of Savo Island]], in which [[United States|American]] [[heavy cruiser]]s {{USS|Astoria|CA-34|2}}, {{USS|Quincy|CA-39|2}}, {{USS|Vincennes|CA-44|2}} and [[Australia]]n heavy cruiser {{HMAS|Canberra|D33|2}} were lost and American heavy cruiser {{USS|Chicago|CA-29|2}} was severely damaged. The transports continued to unload cargo until sailing for [[Nouméa]] that afternoon.

''McCawley'' returned to Guadalcanal 18 September with supplies and reinforcements, departing again the same day with wounded and [[Prisoner of war|POWs]]. The aircraft carrier {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|2}} was lost and [[battleship]] {{USS|North Carolina|BB-55|2}} and [[destroyer]] {{USS|O'Brien|DD-415|2}} were damaged by torpedoes while protecting this troopship convoy.

On 9 October, the transport again got underway for Guadalcanal in a convoy carrying over 2,800 reinforcements. One of the support groups for the convoy was Rear Adm. [[Norman Scott (admiral)|Norman Scott]]'s cruiser force, which, on the night of 11 and 12 October, defeated an enemy force off [[Cape Esperance]], insuring successful completion of the troop movement. ''McCawley'' landed her troops and cargo, returning once more to Nouméa with wounded and POWs.

On 8 November, ''McCawley'' departed Nouméa with other units of TF 67 for Guadalcanal. Two cruisers and three destroyers under Rear Adm. [[Daniel J. Callaghan]] supported them. At the same time, another convoy, covered by a cruiser and four destroyers under Rear Admiral Scott, set out from [[Espiritu Santo]]. Further direct support for the operations was to be supplied by battleships and destroyers of TF 64.

Transports from Espiritu Santo arrived at Lunga Point on 11 November, ''McCawley''{{'}}s group from Nouméa on 12 November. By dusk on 12 November, as reports of [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] ship movements from [[Chuuk State|Truk]] increased, 90% of the transports' lading had been discharged, despite [[torpedo bomber]] attacks.

The transports were pulled out and sent back to Espiritu Santo, while Admiral Callaghan's and Admiral Scott's combined force gallantly engaged the enemy fleet in the initial action of what would later be called the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]]. The battle, lasting from 12 to 15 November, cost the Japanese two battleships, one cruiser, three destroyers, and eleven transports. The United States lost two cruisers and seven destroyers, and Admirals Callaghan and Scott were both killed.

On 24 November, ''McCawley'' departed Nouméa for overhaul at Wellington. She returned to [[New Caledonia]] 10 January 1943 with the 1st [[Marine Raiders]] and the 3rd Parachute Battalion. After discharging those units, she loaded Army troops and construction equipment and resumed supply runs to Guadalcanal. ''McCawley'', redesignated attack transport APA-4 on 1 February 1943, continued to supply Guadalcanal until mid-June. At that time, she began preparations for the [[New Georgia]] and central [[Solomon Islands|Solomons]] campaign.

====Attacked by enemy aircraft====
At 0643 on 30 June, she began off-loading for the landing at [[Rendova Island]], near New Georgia. Twice, before completion at 1350, operations were halted to prepare for air attacks which did not materialize. Then, as the withdrawing column entered Blanche Channel, torpedo planes attacked. ''McCawley'' 's gunfire brought down four; but a torpedo hit in ''McCawley''{{'}}s engine room, killed 15 of her crew, and knocked out all power.

Following the attack, Admiral Turner and his staff transferred to destroyer {{USS|Farenholt|DD-491|2}}. Rear Admiral Wilkinson remained in ''McCawley'' to command salvage operations, while [[attack cargo ship]] {{USS|Libra|AKA-12|2}} took the transport in tow and destroyers {{USS|Ralph Talbot|DD-390|2}} and {{USS|McCalla|DD-488|2}} stood by to assist.

At 1640 all the crew, except the salvage party, were taken off by ''Ralph Talbot''. Soon afterward, the group was attacked by [[dive bomber]]s, and ''McCawley'' was strafed, but no further damage was inflicted as the salvage party manned her guns to shoot down one of the three planes destroyed. By 1850, the draft aft had increased to {{convert|38|ft|m}}, and Admiral Wilkinson ordered ''McCalla'' alongside to take off the salvage party. Within the hour all hands were aboard ''McCalla'' and pulling clear of the stricken transport.

====Accidental sinking====
At 2023 the final blow came. The doomed ship was again torpedoed and in 30 seconds she sank in 340 fathoms. The following day, it was learned that six [[motor Torpedo Boat|motor torpedo boats]] had torpedoed an &quot;enemy&quot; transport in [[Blanche Channel]], after having been informed there were no friendly forces in the area. PTs were then placed directly under Admiral Turner and given a [[liaison officer]] to keep them informed.

===Awards===
''McCawley'' received five [[Service star|battle stars]] for [[World War II]] service.

'''''PT-346''''' was an 80&amp;nbsp;ft [[Electric Launch Company]] (Elco) [[Motor Torpedo Boat|Motor Torpedo (PT) Boat]] which suffered the worst PT-boat [[friendly fire]] casualties of [[World War II]], with nine men killed and nine wounded.

== The incident ==

The majority of all friendly fire PT boat casualties during World War II occurred in the Southwest Pacific in two separate incidents occurring over the span of one month- the first on 27 March 1944, and the second on 29 April 1944. ''PT-346'', skippered by [[Lieutenant]] James Burk, USNR, was the rescue vessel in March and the victim in April. PT boat Squadron 25 took the brunt of both incidents, which resulted in 22 men killed, including Burk, and 28 wounded.

On March 27, 1944, ''PT-346'' and ''PT-354'' rescued the survivors of ''PT-353'' and ''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-121|PT 121]]'', which had been mistakenly destroyed during a mission off the coast of [[New Britain]] by five fighter planes under the command of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]].

Just over a month later, ''PT-346'' itself became the victim of friendly fire. The morning of April 29, 1944, ''PT-346'' was sent to the aid of ''PT-347'', commanded by Lieutenant Robert J. Williams, USNR, and ''PT-350'', skippered by Stanley L. Manning, USNR. ''PT-347'' had become stuck on a reef during a night patrol to intercept enemy barges and destroy shore installations off the coast of [[Rabaul]] in Lassul Bay, located off the northwest corner of New Britain Island in [[New Guinea]]. (The waters of the Pacific were not well charted and during World War II, more PT boats were lost to reefs than to enemy fire.)

At 0700, ''PT-350'' was attempting to dislodge ''PT-347'' from the reef, when two American Marine [[F4U Corsair|Corsair]] planes mistook the PT boats for [[Japan]]ese gunboats and attacked. Taking heavy fire from the planes, ''PT-350'' shot down one of the two attacking [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s, believing them to be [[A6M Zero]]s. With three dead and four wounded and serious mechanical problems, ''PT-350'' headed back to base. ''PT-347'' remained stuck on the reef. Lieutenant Burk headed out with his crew and the base commander of the 25th Squadron, Lieutenant James R. Thompson, USNR, and Chief Pharmacist First Class John Frkovich, USNR, to render medical aid. When ''PT-350'' could not be boarded because of extensive damage, ''PT-346'' headed out to ''PT-347'' to provide assistance. ''PT-346'' arrived at 1230, and at 1400 was still attempting to dislodge ''PT-347'' from the corral heads when planes appeared. The Corsair plane from the morning run brought back an entire squadron of 21 aircraft (four Corsairs, six [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]]s, four [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]] fighters, and eight [[Douglas SBD Dauntless]] [[dive bomber]]s). Recognizing the planes as American and thinking they were the air cover he had ordered, the squadron commander ordered the men to keep working; however, the planes attacked the two boats, still mistaking them for Japanese gunboats. ''PT-346'' did not respond defensively until it was too late, and took heavy casualties. The skipper of ''PT-347'', Lieutenant Williams, who had experienced the earlier attack, ordered his men into the water and to stay dispersed, but two men were killed and three wounded. ''PT-346'' and ''PT-347'' were completely destroyed by bombs, and the men were strafed in the water for approximately one hour, continuing to dive under the water to survive as the planes approached.

Heroes of the day included Wilbur Larsen, USNR, motor machinist’s mate third class of ''PT-347'', who received the Navy Marine Corps medal for saving wounded non-swimmer Forrest May’s life, and Lieutenant James Burk, who received the Purple Heart. Mortally wounded, Burk ordered medic John Frkovich to take his life jacket so he could survive and treat the wounded.

==Causes and inquiry==
Factors that contributed to the incident included an influx of new pilots who lacked experience in recognizing PT boats, poor communications between the planes and PT boats, and the fact that the incident occurred in an area of the Pacific which was the &quot;line of demarcation&quot; between Nimitz and MacArthur’s Pacific commands, which meant that coordination of reports between the two commands did not always occur. A formal inquiry into the incident was conducted and improvements instituted as a result of the tragedy.

'''HNoMS ''Nordkapp''''' was the lead ship of the ''Nordkapp'' class of [[Patrol boat|fishery protection vessels]]. She was launched 18 August 1937 at [[Horten]] [[naval shipyard]], with yard number 123.&lt;ref name=Miramar/&gt; She had one sister ship, [[HNoMS Senja (1937)|HNoMS ''Senja'']]. ''Nordkapp'' was named after the [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]] in [[Finnmark]]. As was typical of her class, ''Nordkapp'' was very unstable in rough seas and was viewed from the beginning as a second-rate vessel. ''Nordkapp'' sailed throughout the [[World War II|Second World War]] and saw service in several theatres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivertsen2000 31&quot;&gt;Sivertsen 2000: 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Nordkapp'' in the Norwegian Campaign==
When the [[Operation Weserübung|Germans invaded Norway]] on 9 April 1940, ''Nordkapp'' was stationed in [[Northern Norway]], belonging to the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]]'s 3rd Naval District&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://niehorster.org/022_norway/navy_03.htm |title=Scandinavian Campaign: Administrative Order of Battle Royal Norwegian Navy 3rd Naval District |accessdate=3 February 2009 |last=Niehorster  |first=Leo |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commanded by [[Lieutenant Commander]] Jon Seip.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abelsen86 211&quot;/&gt; During the [[Norwegian Campaign]] ''Nordkapp'' saw the first actions of her career.

===Sinking ''Kattegat''===

====Background====
In the evening of 9 April ''Nordkapp'' intercepted the 6,031-ton [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Oil tanker|tanker]] [[MS Kattegat (1928)|''Kattegat'']]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodø&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lawson |first =Siri Holm |url=http://www.warsailors.com/homefleet/shipsb2.html#bodo2 |title=M/T Bodø |accessdate=3 February 2009 |work=Warsailors.com |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{csr|register=MSI|id=5606813|accessdate=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Bremen]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Waage83&quot;/&gt; in the [[Glomfjorden]] south of [[Narvik]]. ''Kattegat'' was one of two naval tankers the Germans intended to use in order to quickly refuel the ten destroyers of the [[Battles of Narvik|Narvik task force]], enabling them to escape back to Germany before the [[Royal Navy]] could trap and sink them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivertsen2000 23&quot;/&gt; In preparation of her supply mission, ''Kattegat'' had departed the [[pilot station]] at [[Kopervik]] in [[Western Norway]] on 6 April, scheduled to arrive at Narvik on 9 April.&lt;ref&gt;Waage 1963: 80&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' support tanker had sailed to Norway from [[Wilhelmshaven]] on the German [[North Sea]] coast on 3 April in preparation for the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naval-history.net/xDKWW2-4004-13APR01.htm |title=Naval Events, April 1940, Part 1 of 4 Monday 1st – Sunday 7th |accessdate=3 February 2009 |last=Smith |first=Gordon |work=www.naval-history.net |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the other tanker, the 11,766-ton whale oil [[factory ship]] ''Jan Wellem'', had reached Narvik from the German [[Basis Nord]] at the Bolshaya [[Zapadnaya Litsa Bay|Zapadnaya Litsa]] inlet on the [[Kola Peninsula]] in [[Russia]] before the German attack,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivertsen2000 23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{csr|register=MSI|id=5605562|accessdate=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Kovalev | first=Sergey | title=The Basis Nord Mystery | journal=Oil of Russia International Quarterly Edition | volume= | issue=2 | year=2004 | pages= | url=http://www.oilru.com/or/16/204/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of ''Kattegat'' had been warned of a British [[naval mine]] field in the [[Vestfjorden (Norway)|Vestfjorden]] ([[Operation Wilfred]]) and refused to continue, choosing instead to anchor up in Sandlågbukta, Neverdal at [[Ørnes]] in [[Meløy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivertsen2000 23&quot;/&gt;

====Hailing====
After closing to a [[cable length]] of ''Kattegat'', Lieutenant Commander Seip hailed the German tanker, demanding that it identified itself. In response the German captain signalled that &quot;[[Vidkun Quisling]] had been made the new prime minister of Norway and that all Norwegian [[naval vessel]]s were under orders to cooperate with the German Kriegsmarine&quot;. Seip would receive no information from ''Kattegat'' before he himself had given his name and rank. While this signal exchange was going on ''Kattegat'' dispatched radio messages asking for ''Kriegsmarine'' assistance and escorting the remainder of the way to Narvik.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waage81&quot;&gt;Waage 1963: 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he confronted the German ship, ''Nordkapp''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s commander had been instructed by the 3. Naval District to take her as a [[Prize (law)|prize]], but after speaking with two Norwegian pilots who had guided the German tanker a short time earlier he decided that this would be too hazardous an undertaking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivertsen2000 23&quot;&gt;Sivertsen 2000: 23&lt;/ref&gt;

As the pilots, who had entered ''Nordkapp'' during the patrol boat's signal exchange with ''Kattegat'', reported that the tanker's thirty-nine man crew were all armed and wearing naval uniforms, Seip considered it impossible to [[Boarding (attack)|board]] and seize the ship, since his own 22-man crew had a total of only four [[rifle]]s amongst them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivertsen2000 23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Waage81&quot;/&gt; He assessed that to control the large German crew all the way into the port of [[Bodø]] while being outnumbered and probably out-gunned would have been too difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivertsen2000 23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Waage82&quot;&gt;Waage 1963: 82&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sinking====
In response to the aggressive signals received from ''Kattegat'', Seip signalled back a short message telling the German crew to abandon ship within 10 minutes or face the consequences. At the end of the ten minutes no reaction from the German crew had been observed and ''Nordkapp'' fired a warning shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waage82&quot;/&gt; As still no reaction could be seen in the protruding darkness, four 47&amp;nbsp;mm rounds were fired into ''Kattegat's'' [[waterline]]. As the Germans had opened their ship's valves while leaving the tanker, ''Kattegat'' sank quickly. Thirty-four of the crew were brought on board ''Nordkapp'' as [[Prisoner of war|PoW]]s from a nearby wharf, while the remaining five managed to escape into the hills after their ship was sunk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivertsen2000 23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Waage82&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vrakdykking.com/narvik6.htm |title=Sjøslagene ved Narvik 10. april 1940 |accessdate=3 February 2009 |last=Andresen |first=Dag-Jostein |date=2 April 2004 |work=Vrakdykking i Nord- og Midt-Norge |publisher= |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 34 PoWs from the German tanker were brought to [[Mosjøen]] and handed over to military authorities there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waage82&quot;/&gt;

====Consequences and aftermath====
The effect of removing ''Kattegat'' from the Germans' [[Military logistics|supply chain]] was devastating,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The German Fleet at War, 1939&amp;ndash;1945 |last=O'Hara |first=Vincent P. |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location= |isbn= 978-1-59114-651-3|page=32 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z85Xh21qniEC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=German+tanker+%22kattegat%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the German destroyers at Narvik could only be refuelled two at a time, instead of the planned four at a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivertsen2001-86&quot;&gt;Sivertsen 2001: 86&lt;/ref&gt; Also, ''Jan Wellem'' did not hold enough fuel for all 10 of the German destroyers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waage82&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Denmark and Norway 1940 |last=Dildy |first=Douglas C. |authorlink= |author2=John White |year=2007 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |location= |isbn= 978-1-84603-117-5|page=47 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjDG09h86OwC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=German+tanker+%22kattegat%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the German warships at Narvik failed to make their escape in time and were destroyed by the Royal Navy in the [[Battles of Narvik]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Waage82&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivertsen2001-86&quot;/&gt; As the five-destroyer-strong 2nd Destroyer Flotilla under Commodore [[Bernard Warburton-Lee]] entered the [[Ofotfjord]] on 10 April to initiate the [[Battles of Narvik|First Battle of Narvik]], Vice Admiral William Whitworth, in charge of the Royal Navy forces in the Narvik area, received a message from Norway stating that ''Kattegat'' had been intercepted and sunk {{convert|3|nmi|km|2}} off shore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waage83&quot;&gt;Waage 1963: 83&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kattegat'' was later [[Marine salvage|salvaged]] by the Norwegian military, with 1,400 tons of diesel and 207 barrels of grease unloaded at [[Svolvær]]. On 15 May, before ''Kattegat'' was ready to sail to [[Tromsø]], she was bombed and damaged by a German aircraft. As the damaged ship still held 5,000 tons of oil, the local [[Fishing vessel|fishing boat]] fleet helped themselves to the cargo until the Germans arrived to retake the ship after the capitulation of mainland Norway in June.&lt;ref&gt;Sivertsen 2000: 24&lt;/ref&gt; The short time ''Kattegat'' was in Norwegian hands she served under the name MT ''Bodø''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodø&quot;/&gt;

===Guard and escort duties===
The next task for ''Nordkapp'' after she had dealt with ''Kattegatt'' came on 13 April, when she was ordered to go to  [[Brønnøysund]]. A German [[Heinkel He 115]] seaplane had landed there after running out of fuel and been seized by the local police, who had taken the four German airmen into custody. The aircraft was captured intact with a full bomb load and was later flown to Tromsø by [[Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service]] lieutenant Sivertsen and pressed into Norwegian service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivertsen2000 32&quot;&gt;Sivertsen 2000: 32&lt;/ref&gt;

From 16 to 22 April ''Nordkapp'' was deployed with a Royal Navy squadron of 14 warships and two [[troopship]]s that had arrived at [[Sjonafjord]] north of [[Sandnessjøen]]. As the force split up and some of the destroyers sailed south, ''Nordkapp'' followed the main force north. During the time she followed the British vessels, the force was subjected to several German air attacks without the Norwegian ship suffering any damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivertsen2000 32&quot;/&gt;

===Patrol and bombardment missions===
After leaving the British task force, ''Nordkapp'' spent most of her time until late May patrolling and guarding a British mine field in the [[Andfjord]] in northern [[Nordland]] / southern [[Troms]].

At 24 May she called at Bodø, and by 30 May the evacuation of 4,000 [[British Army]] troops from the Bodø region began. By that time Bodø had been heavily bombed by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' over several days, and German troops was observed advancing towards [[Røsvik]]  north-east of Bodø. On 3 June ''Nordkapp'' was despatched together with the 463-ton British-operated [[Q-ship]] ''Ranen''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lawson |first =Siri Holm |url=http://www.warsailors.com/freefleet/norfleetr.html#ranen |title=D/S Ranen |accessdate=3 February 2009 |work=Warsailors.com |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Leirfjord]] to try to stop the advance of the enemy by sea. The two ships [[Naval Gunfire Support|bombarded]] German forces in the area before splitting up and heading north, ''Nordkapp'' sailing to Svolvær.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivertsen2000 32&quot;/&gt;

===Friendly fire incident and evacuation===
On 7 June 1940 ''Nordkapp'' arrived at Svolvær and received the order that had been given by the Norwegian High Command to evacuate all operational naval vessels to allied ports. While most of the thirteen navy ships that escaped the capitulation of mainland Norway started their journeys that day, ''Nordkapp'' remained until the early hours of the next day in order to give refugees and volunteers more time to gather for the voyage to the [[United Kingdom]]. According to Lieutenant Commander Seip's orders, his ship's first destination abroad was to be the [[Faroe Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berg97 32&quot;&gt;Berg 1997: 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the evening of 7 June German aircraft bombed and destroyed an oil tank facility in the town. At around 0200hrs, before ''Nordkapp'' was ready to sail west and start five years of service [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile|in exile]], two ships arrived at Svolvær and started destroying the remaining oil tanks with artillery fire. Assuming the ships to be German the second in command of ''Nordkapp'', Ensign Andersen, who was in command of the ship as Lieutenant Commander Seip was in a conference on land at the time, sailed out and attacked the two unknown ships. As he opened up on the two ships with his single cannon, they quickly returned fire and a 45-minute artillery duel ensued. Neither side managed to hit their adversary during the fight, and eventually the two sides discovered each other's true identity. The ships ''Nordkapp'' had been battling for three quarters of an hour were ''Ranen'' and the 655-ton Royal Navy [[Anti-submarine warfare|ASW]] [[Naval trawler|trawler]] [[HMT Northern Gem|''Northern Gem'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/6427.html |title=HMS Northern Gem (FY 194) |accessdate=3 February 2009 |last=Helgason |first=Guðmundur |work=www.uboat.net |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ranen'' had been bombarding German positions together with ''Nordkapp'' just four days previously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berg97 32&quot;/&gt;

After the nearly fatal [[friendly fire]] incident, ''Nordkapp'' returned to Svolvær and took on board volunteers before leaving port at 0300hrs on 8 June.&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1997: 33&lt;/ref&gt; The passengers included 19 Royal Norwegian Navy personnel, many of whom were crew members of vessels sunk in the preceding two months.&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1997: 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June ''Nordkapp'' joined the [[Operation Alphabet|British evacuation convoy]]. During the journey west the ships were attacked by German bombers but avoided suffering any damage.&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1997: 34&lt;/ref&gt;

After four days at sea ''Nordkapp'' reached [[Tórshavn]] on the Faroe Islands on 12 June,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abelsen86 211&quot;/&gt; resupplying before continuing on to the United Kingdom.

==Service abroad==

===Iceland and the Shetland Bus===
After arrival at [[Rosyth]] in [[Scotland]] on 18 June 1940 ''Nordkapp'' was rebuilt and rearmed&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivertsen99-206&quot;/&gt; and was declared operational on 14 September 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abelsen86: 85&quot;/&gt; She was posted to [[Iceland]] from 21 September 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abelsen86 211&quot;/&gt; On Iceland she served as a patrol vessel until 9 September 1943 when she was transferred to [[Shetland]] in order to support the [[Shetland bus]] operations. At Shetland she operated from 22 September 1943&lt;ref name=&quot;Abelsen86: 85&quot;/&gt; together with the RNoN patrol vessels ''Horten'', ''Molde'', ''Narvik'' and ''Risør''.&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1997: 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Neptune and Scapa Flow===
Between [[D-day]] and 18 June 1944 ''Nordkapp'' took part in [[Operation Neptune]], the naval part of the [[invasion of Normandy]]. On 6 June she escorted a convoy of transports from [[Southend-on-Sea]] in the [[East of England]] to the British invasion beaches and thereafter escorted ships along the coast of [[Normandy]].&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1997: 142&lt;/ref&gt; The main threat from which she protected allied shipping was that of German [[E-boat]] and [[U-boat]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Berg 1997: 136&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 September 1944 she sailed from [[Portland Harbour|Portland]] to [[Aberdeen]] for maintenance and stayed there until 15 December 1944 when she was again transferred,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomassen&quot;&gt;Thomassen 1995: 229&lt;/ref&gt; this time to guard duties at the [[Home Fleet]]'s main base at [[Scapa Flow]], a role she would continue until 1 January 1945. Thereafter she moved to [[Lerwick]], [[Shetland]] where she was based until [[Victory in Europe Day|VE day]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Abelsen86: 85&quot;/&gt;

==Return to Norway==
On 18 May 1945, ten days after the final [[Victory in Europe Day|German surrender in Norway]], ''Nordkapp'' left her exile in [[Methil]] in the United Kingdom and sailed for home. Two days later, on 20 May, she arrived at her new base at the south-western port of [[Stavanger]], ending almost five years of exile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomassen&quot;/&gt;

==Post-war==
After the end of the Second World War ''Nordkapp'' resumed her pre-war duties as a [[coast guard]] vessel until being decommissioned and laid up in Horten on 29 July 1954. She was sold off to civilian ownership in 1956, finding a new career as a fishing vessel under two owners, first as ''Skarodd'' and then from 1971 as ''Tor Hugo''. Her long career ended on 27 November 1972, when she sank off [[West Africa]] after suffering leaks and disastrous [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abelsen86: 85&quot;/&gt;

'''HMS ''Oxley''''' (originally '''HMAS ''Oxley''''') was an {{sclass|Odin|submarine}} of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) and [[Royal Navy]] (RN).

==Design and construction==
{{main|Odin-class submarine}}
The {{sclass|Odin|submarine}}s were built to a slightly modified design for Australian service.&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt; They were {{convert|275|ft}} in [[length overall]], with a beam of {{convert|29|ft|7|in}}, and a mean draught of {{convert|13|ft|3|in}}.&lt;ref name=Bastock110&gt;Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Displacement was 1,350 tons when surfaced, and 1,870 tons when submerged.&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt; The boats had diesel motors for surface running and electricity generation, but when underwater ran off electric motors.&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt; They had two propeller shafts.&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt; Maximum speed was {{convert|15.5|kn}} on the surface, and {{convert|9|kn}} when dived.&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt; ''Oxley'' had a ship's company of 54.&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt; Armament consisted of eight {{convert|21|in|adj=on}} torpedo tubes (six facing forward, two facing aft), one {{convert|4|in|adj=on}} deck gun, and two machine guns.&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt;

''Oxley'' was laid down by Vickers-Armstrong Limited at [[Barrow-in-Furness]], England in March 1925, under the designation ''OA1''.&lt;ref name=Bastock112&gt;Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SPC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-oxley-i |title=HMAS Oxley (I) |work=HMA Ship Histories |publisher=Sea Power Centre - Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=20 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was launched on 29 June 1926, completed on 22 July 1927, and commissioned into the RAN on 1 April 1927.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; The submarine was named after explorer [[John Oxley]].&lt;ref name=Bastock112/&gt;

==Operational history==
After commissioning, ''Oxley'' and ''Otway'' were temporarily assigned to the Royal Navy's [[5th Submarine Flotilla]].&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt; On 8 February 1928, the two submarines set out for Australia in the longest unescorted voyage undertaken by a British submarine.&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt; The submarines were diverted to Malta after cracks were found on ''Otway''{{'}}s engine columns.&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt; On arrival in Malta, similar fractures were found in ''Oxley''{{'}}s engine columns, and the two boats were detained while improved columns were fabricated and installed.&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt; They resumed their voyage in November, and reached Sydney on 14 February 1929.&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt; Because of the deteriorating financial conditions leading into the [[Great Depression in Australia|Great Depression]], the two submarines were placed into reserve a year later;&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt; ''Oxley'' was paid off into Reserve on 10 May 1930.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; ''Oxley'' underwent diving exercises every second week until 9 April 1931,&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; when the submarine was paid off in full prior to transfer to the RN.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt;

The ongoing cost of maintaining the boats, coupled with the tonnage limits imposed by the [[London Naval Treaty]] prompted the Australian government to offer ''Oxley'' and ''Otway'' to the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt; The submarines were transferred and commissioned on 10 April 1931.&lt;ref name=Bastock110/&gt;

On 29 April, ''Oxley'' and ''Otway'' (which had also been recommissioned into the RN) left Sydney for Malta.&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; During 1939, the submarine was based at Portsmouth as part of the 5th Submarine Flotilla.&lt;ref name=NMM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/pdf/Warship_Histories_Vessels_iii.pdf|title=NMM, vessel ID 327625|work=Warship Histories, vol iii|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the onset of war the submarine was a member of the 2nd Submarine Flotilla. From 26-29 August 1939, the 2nd Submarine Flotilla deployed to its war bases at [[Dundee]] and Blyth.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outbreak of the Second World War, ''Oxley'' was assigned to patrol duties off the coast of [[Norway]].&lt;ref name=SPC/&gt; She was assigned the [[pennant number]] 55.&lt;ref name=Bastock112/&gt;

==Loss==
{{refimprove|section|date=September 2016}}
On 10 September 1939, ''Oxley'' was sunk by [[HMS Triton (N15)|HMS ''Triton'']]. ''Oxley'' was the first British submarine lost during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name=Bastock112/&gt;

When the Admiralty was notified that His Majesty's Government would declare war on Germany, five submarines of the Second Flotilla, including HMS ''Triton'' and HMS ''Oxley'', were ordered to patrol on the Obrestad line off Norway on 24 August 1939. Thus, on 3 September all British submarines were in their combat patrol sectors.

At 1955 on 10 September 1939, ''Triton'' had surfaced, fixed a position off the Obrestad Light, set a slow zigzag patrol, and began charging batteries. Lieutenant Commander Steel, having verified that the area was clear and having posted lookouts, gave the bridge to the officer of the watch and went below, leaving orders that he was to be called if anything unusual appeared. At 2045, he was called to the bridge when an object in the water could be seen very fine on the port bow.

Steel ordered propulsion shifted to the main motors, the signalman to the bridge, and torpedo tubes 7 and 8 readied for firing. The object was recognized as a submarine low in the water.

Once on the bridge, the signalman sent three challenges over several minutes with the box lamp, none of which were answered. Steel wondered if the boat could be HMS ''Oxley'', which should have been patrolling next in line, but some distance away. Steel and his bridge crew studied the silhouette, but could not distinguish what type of submarine it was.

A fourth challenge was sent: three green rifle-grenade flares. After firing, Steel counted slowly to 15 and then decided that they were seeing a German U-boat. He ordered tubes 7 and 8 fired with a three-second interval. Less than a minute later, an explosion was heard.

''Triton'' moved into the area to investigate and heard cries for help. The light from the Aldis lamp revealed three men floundering amid oil and debris.

Lieutenant Guy C. I. St.B. Watkins and Lieutenant Harry A. Stacey entered the water and rescued Lieutenant Commander H.G. Bowerman, ''Oxley'''s commanding officer, as well as Able Seaman Gluckes, a lookout. The third person in the water, Lieutenant F.K. Manley, was seen to be swimming strongly when he suddenly sank from view. Neither Manley's body nor any other survivors from ''Oxley'' were found.

A Board of Enquiry found that Steel had done all he reasonably could in the circumstances. ''Oxley'' was out of position, ''Triton'' had acted correctly, and the first Allied submarine casualty of World War II was due to &quot;friendly fire.&quot; During the war, the loss of ''Oxley'' was attributed to an accidental explosion. After the war, it was explained to have been a collision with ''Triton''. The truth was not revealed until the 1950s.

== Memorial ==

As ''Oxley'' was operating from Dundee with the 2nd Submarine Flotilla when she was lost, her crew are all commemorated on [[Dundee International Submarine Memorial]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dundee-International-Submarine-Memorial/178502908906382&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Porter'' (DD-356)''' was the [[lead ship]] in [[Porter class destroyer|her class]] of [[destroyer]]s in the [[United States Navy]]. She was the third Navy ship named for [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]] and his son, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[David Dixon Porter]].

==Operational history==
===Construction===
''Porter'' was laid down by the [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]] at [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] in [[New Jersey]] on 18 December 1933, launched on 12 December 1935 by Miss Carlile Patterson Porter and commissioned at [[Philadelphia]] on 27 August 1936, [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Forrest B. Royal in command.

===1936-1941===
After shakedown in waters off [[Northern Europe]], ''Porter'' visited [[St. John's, Newfoundland]], for ceremonies in honor of the [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth]] in May 1937 and was at the [[Washington Navy Yard]] during the Boy Scout Jamboree, June–July 1937.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Then reassigned to the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], she transited the [[Panama Canal]] and arrived at [[San Francisco, California]] 5 August 1937. She operated continuously with the Pacific Fleet until the outbreak of [[World War II]], homeported at [[San Diego, California]].

===World War II===
On 5 December 1941, ''Porter'' got underway from [[Pearl Harbor]], escaping the [[Japan]]ese [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attack]] by two days. She patrolled with [[cruiser]]s and destroyers in [[Hawaii]]an waters before steaming in convoy 25 March 1942 for the west coast.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} She operated off the west coast with Task Force 1 (TF&amp;nbsp;1) for the next 4 months. Returning to Pearl Harbor in mid-August, she trained in Hawaiian waters until 16 October when she sortied with TF&amp;nbsp;16 and headed for the [[Solomon Islands]].

====Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands====
On 26 October 1942, TF&amp;nbsp;16 exchanged air attacks with strong Japanese forces northeast of [[Guadalcanal]] in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]. During the ensuing action, ''Porter'' was torpedoed, and, after the crew had abandoned ship, was sunk by gunfire from [[USS Shaw (DD-373)|''Shaw'']] (DD-373).  Authorities differ as to the source of the torpedo which sunk ''Porter''.  Author Eric Hammel states Porter was sunk by a single torpedo, part of a three-torpedo spread fired from Japanese [[submarine]] [[Japanese submarine I-21|''I-21'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammel|first=Eric|title=Guadalcanal: The Carrier Battles|year=1987|publisher=Crown Publishers, Inc.|location=New York|pages=411–413}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, author Richard B. Frank states that Japanese records don't support this, and that, more likely, an errant torpedo from a ditching US Navy [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] hit ''Porter'' and caused the fatal damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}} p. 388-389.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] 2 November 1942.

''Porter'' earned one [[battle star]] for World War II service.

'''''PT-121''''' was a [[PT boat|motor torpedo boat]] of the [[United States Navy]], built by the [[Electric Launch Company]] (ELCO) of [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], launched in 1942, and sunk in a [[friendly fire]] incident on 27 March 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Navsource&quot;/&gt;

==Service history==
On the morning of March 27, 1944, Lt. Crowell C. Hall, USNR, executive officer of Squadron 25, in ''PT-353'' (Ens. George H. Guckert, USNR), with ''PT-121'' (Ens. Richard B. Secrest, USNR), was trying to thread a way through [[New Britain|New Britain's]] reefs to Ewasse, in Bangula Bay, to investigate a reported enemy [[schooner]]. At 0745, four [[Curtiss P-40|P-40s]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] of [[No. 78 Squadron RAAF|78 Squadron]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] operating out of [[Kiriwina]], flew over and Lieutenant Hall asked them by radio to investigate the schooner. The aircraft complied, and reported it had been strafed previously and was no longer a worthwhile target. No sooner had the boats turned to leave than they were attacked by four other P-40s of 78 Squadron and a [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]] [[heavy fighter]] of [[No. 30 Squadron RAAF|30 Squadron RAAF]]. A second Beaufighter recognized the PTs and throughout the attack attempted to call off the other Beaufighter by radio and to maneuver to head off the P-40s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Navsource&quot;/&gt;

No order to open fire was given on either boat. After the aircraft made several runs, gunners on the ''PT-353'' fired seven or eight rounds of 40&amp;nbsp;mm and five rounds of 37&amp;nbsp;mm, and those on the ''PT-121'' fired seven rounds of 20&amp;nbsp;mm and three short bursts of .50 caliber gunfire. Lieutenant Hall on the ''PT-353'' and Ensign Secrest on the ''PT-121'' stopped the firing immediately. Both boats burned, exploded, and sank, except for a portion of the bow of the ''PT-121''. Shortly after the attack, two P-40s of the group that had investigated the schooner returned. They dropped a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|liferaft]] to the survivors and sent in a radio report of the tragedy. Five hours later, a P-40 guided ''PT-346'' and ''PT-354'' to the survivors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Navsource&quot;/&gt;

Four officers and four enlisted men were dead; four officers and eight enlisted men were wounded; two PTs were completely destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Navsource&quot;/&gt;

In part, the losses were caused by a failure in communication. The message reporting the intended movements of PTs had been placed in the wrong file at 78 Squadron headquarters, so the pilots had not been told that PTs would be operating in the area. In part, the losses were caused by failure of the pilots to recognize the PTs. The first P-40s recognized them and gave them a helping hand. One Beaufighter in the second group recognized them and tried to stop the attack. The other pilots simply mistook them for enemy craft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Navsource&quot;/&gt;

After an investigation by the Navy, Ensign Secrest received the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Navsource&quot;/&gt;

'''USS ''R-19'' (SS-96)''' was an [[United States R-class submarine|R-class coastal and harbor defense submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]].

==Construction and commissioning==
''R-19''{{'}}s [[keel]] was laid down by the [[Union Iron Works]] of San Francisco on 23 June 1917. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 28 January 1918 sponsored by Mrs. Robert L. Irvine, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 7 October 1918 with [[Lieutenant Commander]] William F. Callaway in command.

==United States Navy service==
After commissioning, which was one month before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]] ending [[World War I]] took effect, ''R-19'' remained on the [[United States West Coast|West Coast]] of the United States for nine months at [[San Pedro, California]] until March 1919, and then at San Francisco, undergoing overhaul, until June 1919. On 17 June 1919 ''R-19'' left the United States for the [[Territory of Hawaii]]. Eight days later she reached [[Pearl Harbor]] in Hawaii and began almost 12 years of training submarine crews and testing equipment.

During July 1920 the [[hull classification symbol]] of ''R-19'' was changed from &quot;Submarine Number 96&quot; to &quot;SS-96.&quot;

On 12 December 1930, ''R-19'' left [[Pearl Harbor]] for the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]]. ''En route'' she called at San Diego; voyaged south to the [[Panama Canal Zone]]; negotiated the [[Panama Canal]]; then voyaged north through the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the coastal waters of the [[United States East Coast|US East Coast]]; and, finally, up [[Delaware Bay]] and the [[Delaware River]] to Philadelphia.

On 15 May 1931, ''R-19'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and placed in the [[reserve fleet]] at that [[shipyard]], where she remained berthed at [[League Island]] for the next nine years.

''R-19'' was recommissioned on 6 January 1941, then went to the [[Naval Submarine Base New London]] at [[Groton, Connecticut]], where she was reconditioned. During May 1941, ''R-19'' headed south. For the remainder of the spring, summer, and into the fall of 1941, she patrolled and conducted training exercises in the [[Virgin Islands]] and off the Panama Canal Zone. In October 1941, ''R-19'' returned to Groton and continued her role as a training submarine.

On 9 March 1942, ''R-19'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] again.

For her service in the United States Navy, the ''R-19'' was eligible for the [[World War I Victory Medal (United States)|World War I Victory Medal]], [[American Defense Service Medal]], [[American Campaign Medal]] and the [[World War II Victory Medal]].

==Royal Navy service as HMS ''P.514''==
[[File:Swinbrook StMaryV MonumentPhillimore.JPG|thumb|left|Church monument at [[Swinbrook]], England, to Lt. Phillimore and the crew of HMS ''P.514'']]
''R-19'' was transferred to the United Kingdom under the terms of [[Lend-Lease]] on 9 March 1942. Commissioned into the [[Royal Navy]], she was renamed HMS ''P.514''.

In June 1942 she sailed for [[St. Johns, Newfoundland]] under the command of [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Walter Phillimore, RN.&lt;ref name=Monument&gt;Text of monument in the parish church of St Mary the Virgin, [[Swinbrook]]&lt;/ref&gt; At 0300 on 21 June 1942, ''P.514'' encountered a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]], {{HMCS|Georgian}}. Unaware of any friendly submarines in the area and receiving no reply to her challenge, ''Georgian'' rammed ''P.514'', which sank with the loss of all hands.&lt;ref name=Monument/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/centennial/background/background_e.asp?category=70&amp;title=193 |title=Canadian Navy Background Information June |publisher=navy.forces.gc.ca |accessdate= 2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Board of Inquiry]] ruled that ''Georgian''{{'}}s [[commanding officer]] had acted correctly.

Lt. Phillimore's parents lived at [[Swinbrook]], Oxfordshire, England.&lt;ref name=Monument/&gt; There is a memorial to ''P.514''{{'}}s officers and men in the [[Church of England parish church]] of St. Mary the Virgin in Swinbrook.

'''USS ''S-26'' (SS-131)''' was an [[United States S class submarine|''S''-class]] [[submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]]. Her keel was laid down on 7 November 1919 by [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation]]'s [[Fore River Shipyard]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]. She [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 22 August 1922 sponsored by Mrs. Carlos Bean, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 15 October 1923 with [[Lieutenant]] Edmund W. Burrough in command.

Operating out of [[New London, Connecticut]] from 1923–1925, ''S-26'' visited [[Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] and [[Trinidad]] from January–April 1924, and [[Hawaii]] from 27 April-30 May 1925. Cruising from [[California]] ports, mainly [[Mare Island, California|Mare Island]], [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], and [[San Pedro, California]], ''S-26'' visited [[Hawaii]] in the summers of 1927-1930. She also served in the [[Panama Canal]] area from March–May 1927, and in February 1929. Departing San Diego on 1 December 1930, she arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]] on 12 December. From then into 1938, ''S-26'' served at Pearl Harbor. Sailing from there on 15 October 1938, she returned to New London on 25 March 1939. Entering a period of partial duty on 15 April that year, she resumed full duty on 1 July 1940.

Following duty at New London and hydrogen tests at [[Washington, DC]], ''S-26'' sailed from New London on 10 December 1941, and arrived at [[Coco Solo, Panama]] on 19 December. Accidentally rammed by the submarine chaser {{USS|Sturdy|PC-460|2}} at night in the [[Gulf of Panama]], ''S-26'' sank on 24 January 1942 with the loss of 46 men.&lt;ref name=USSubCasualties1966&gt;{{cite journal |title=Submarine Casualties Booklet |publisher=U.S. Naval Submarine School |year=1966 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/8200 |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three men, the Captain, [[Executive Officer]], and a lookout, survived. Though divers were sent down to the wreck over the following days, her hull was not salvaged.

'''HMS ''Sunfish''''' was a [[Royal Navy]] [[British S-class submarine (1931)|S-class]] [[submarine]] which was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 30 September 1936 and fought in the [[Second World War]]. ''Sunfish'' is one of 12 boats named in the song [[British S class submarine (1931)#Service losses|Twelve Little S-Boats]].

==Service history==
At the onset of the Second World War, ''Sunfish'' was a member of the 2nd Submarine Flotilla. From 26-29 August 1939, the flotilla deployed to its war bases at [[Dundee]] and Blyth.&lt;ref name=rohwer1&gt;Rohwer, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

She spent an eventful period with the Royal Navy on the outbreak of war, and was commanded for much of her career in the war by [[Lieutenant Commander]] J.E. Slaughter. In February 1940, she attacked ''U-14'', but failed to sink her, and in April sank two [[Kriegsmarine|German]] merchant ships, the Amasis and the Antares, and narrowly missed out on sinking the ''Hanau'' and an auxiliary patrol vessel.

She also sank a couple of German '[[Q ship]]s' that month, the ''Schürbeck'' and the ''Oldenburg''. On 7 December 1940, she sank the Finnish merchant {{SS|Oscar Midling|1889|2}} and damaged the Norwegian merchant ''Dixie'' off [[Norway]].

''Sunfish'' was transferred to the [[Soviet Navy]] in 1944 and renamed ''V-1''.

She did not spend long under Soviet command, being bombed and sunk in error by a [[RAF Coastal Command]] [[Consolidated Liberator I|Liberator]] off Norway, during passage from Dundee to [[Murmansk]] on 27 July 1944. Her commander – [[Israel Fisanovich|Capt. 2nd rank Fisanovich]] – had allegedly taken her out of her assigned area and she was diving when the aircraft came in sight instead of staying on the surface and firing recognition signals as instructed. All crew – including the British liaison staff – were lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/3428.html HMS Sunfish], Uboat.net&lt;/ref&gt; However, both the Royal Navy and RAF inquiries found that the RAF aircrew, who were at least 80 miles off course and who ignored unmistakable signs that the submarine was friendly, were fully responsible. The submarine's 50 Russian and one British crew are all commemorated on [[Dundee International Submarine Memorial]].

'''HMS ''Unbeaten''''' was a [[British U-class submarine|U-class]] [[submarine]], of the second group of that class, built by [[Vickers Armstrong]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]]. She was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 22 November 1939 and was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 10 November 1940. So far she has been the only ship of the [[Royal Navy]] to bear the name ''Unbeaten''.

==Career==
''Unbeaten'' spent much of her career operating in the [[Mediterranean]], where she sank the Italian sailing vessel V 51 / ''Alfa'', the Vichy-French merchant ''PLM 20'', the {{ship|Italian submarine|Guglielmotti}} and the German submarine {{GS|U-374||2}}. She also claimed to have sunk two sailing vessels with gunfire. Until today there is no confirmation from Italian or German sources as to the identity of the vessels attacked. It is also quite possible that the vessels were only damaged.

''Unbeaten'' also lightly damaged the Italian merchant ''Vettor Pisani'' on 16 March 1942.&lt;ref&gt;See 'La Difesa del Trafico con L'Africa Settentrionale', the official Italian naval history. Vettor Pisani was lost to air attack on 24 July 1942. There is also no record in the official Admiralty naval staff history 'Submarines in the Mediterranean Vol. II&lt;/ref&gt; She also unsuccessfully attacked the Italian merchant ''Silvio Scaroni'', the Italian troop transport ''Esperia'' and a large Italian troop transport, thought to be either ''Oceania'' or ''Neptunia''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/3389.html HMS Unbeaten], Uboot.net&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sinking==

After a refit in Chatham, and subsequent workup, ''Unbeaten'' was attached to the Third Submarine Flotilla in Scotland.  Having sailed from [[Holy Loch]] on her last patrol, ''Unbeaten'' completed Operation Bluestone, landing an agent in Spain near [[Baiona, Pontevedra|Bayona]]. She then completed her patrol in the [[Bay of Biscay]] and was returning to the UK when she went missing.  It is believed that she was probably attacked and sunk in error by an [[Royal Air Force]] [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington]] of No. 172 Squadron, [[Coastal Command]] in the Bay of Biscay on 11 November 1942 .  She was lost with all hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnsubmus.co.uk/general/losses.htm Submarine losses 1904 to present day], RN Submarine Museum, Gosport&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commanding officers==

Her first CO was Edward &quot;Teddy&quot; Woodward. Her second and last CO was Lt Donald Ogilvy Watson.

The '''German destroyer Z1 ''Leberecht Maass''''' was a [[German World War II destroyers|Type 1934]] [[destroyer]] built for the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during the 1930s. The ship was named after [[Rear Admiral]] [[Leberecht Maass]] who commanded German forces in the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in August 1914.&lt;ref name=ks7&gt;Koop &amp; Schmolke, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Several days after the start of [[World War II]], she unsuccessfully attacked, together with another destroyer, Polish ships anchored at the naval base on the [[Hel Peninsula]]. ''Leberecht Maass'' was lightly damaged during the action. In mid-February 1940, while proceeding into the [[North Sea]] to search for British [[fishing trawler]]s, the ship was bombed by a patrolling German bomber that damaged her steering. She either drifted into a newly laid British [[minefield]] or was again hit by bombs and broke in half with the loss of the bulk of her crew.

==Design and description==
''Leberecht Maass'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|119|m|ftin|sp=us}} and was {{convert|114|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length at the waterline|long at the waterline]]. The ship had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|11.30|m|ftin|sp=us}}, and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.23|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She displaced {{convert|2223|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard load]] and {{convert|3156|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The two Wagner geared [[steam turbine]] sets, each driving one [[propeller shaft]], were designed to produce {{convert|70000|PS|kW shp|lk=on|abbr=on}} using steam provided by six high-pressure Wagner [[boiler]]s. The ship had a designed speed of {{convert|36|kn|link=on}}, but her maximum speed was {{convert|38.7|kn}}.&lt;ref name=g9&gt;Gröner, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leberecht Maass'' carried a maximum of {{convert|752|t|LT|0|sp=us}} of [[fuel oil]] which was intended to give a range of {{convert|4400|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|19|kn}}, but the ship proved top-heavy in service and 30% of the fuel had to be retained as [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] low in the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The effective range proved to be only {{convert|1530|nmi|abbr=on}} at 19 knots.&lt;ref&gt;Koop &amp; Schmolke, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship carried five [[12.7 cm SK C/34 naval gun|12.7 cm SK C/34 guns]] in single mounts with [[gun shield]]s, two each [[superfire|superimposed]], fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the aft [[superstructure]]. Her [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] armament consisted of four [[3.7 cm SK C/30]] guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] and six [[2 cm FlaK 30/38/Flakvierling|2 cm C/30]] guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above-water {{convert|53.3|cm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s in two power-operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount.&lt;ref name=g9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Four [[depth charge]] throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 [[naval mine|mine]]s.&lt;ref name=g9/&gt; A system of passive [[hydrophone]]s designated as 'GHG' (''[[Gruppenhorchgerät]]'') was fitted to detect [[submarine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; The crew numbered 10 officers and 315 enlisted men, plus an additional four officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a [[flotilla]] [[flagship]].&lt;ref name=g9/&gt;

==Service history==
''Leberecht Maass'' was the first destroyer to be built in [[Germany]] since [[World War I]]. The ship was ordered on 7 July 1934 and [[Keel|laid down]] at [[Deutsche Werke]], [[Kiel]], on 10 October 1934 as yard number K232. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 18 August 1935 and completed on 14 January 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; She became the flagship of the ''Führer der Torpedoboote'' (Chief of Torpedo Boats) upon commissioning. ''Leberecht Maass'' spent most of her first year training and made a port visit to [[Gothenburg]] in April 1938. Upon her return she was taken in hand by Deutsche Werke to have her bow rebuilt to reduce the amount of water that came over the bow in [[head sea]]s. The ship participated in the August 1938 [[Fleet Review]] and the following fleet exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; In December, ''Leberecht Maass'', together with her [[sister ship|sisters]] [[German destroyer Z2 Georg Thiele|Z2 ''Georg Thiele'']], [[German destroyer Z3 Max Schultz|Z3 ''Max Schultz'']], and [[German destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen|Z4 ''Richard Beitzen'']], sailed to the area of [[Iceland]] to evaluate her seaworthiness in a [[North Atlantic]] winter with her new bow. On 23–24 March 1939, the ship was one of the destroyers that escorted [[Adolf Hitler]] aboard the [[pocket battleship]] {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}} to [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|occupy Memel]].&lt;ref name=ks7/&gt; She participated in the Spring fleet exercise in the western Mediterranean, as the flagship of Rear Admiral [[Günther Lütjens]], and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 1939, Z1 ''Leberecht Maass'' and {{ship|German destroyer|Z9 Wolfgang Zenker||2}} took part in an attack on the Polish ships {{ship|ORP|Gryf||2}} and {{ship|ORP|Wicher|1928|2}} in [[Gdynia]] harbour. The Poles replied effectively and forced the German destroyers to make evasive maneuvers and to lay a [[smoke screen]] to throw off the aim of the Polish gunners. ''Leberecht Maass'' was hit in the superstructure by a {{convert|152|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} shell from the [[Coastal artillery|coast defense]] [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|battery]] at [[Hel, Poland|Hel]] that killed four crewmen and wounded another four men. Lütjens ordered the action broken off 40 minutes later as the German fire was ineffective. The following day, she sailed to [[Swinemünde]] to have her damage repaired, a process that took until 10 September. After its completion, ''Leberecht Maass'' helped to lay defensive minefields in the North Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 83–85&lt;/ref&gt; The ship began a scheduled refit in Swinemünde on 29 September&lt;ref name=ks8/&gt; and Lutjens transferred his flag to {{ship|German destroyer|Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; She was attached to the [[2nd Destroyer Flotilla (Germany)|2nd Destroyer Flotilla]] on 22 December.&lt;ref name=ks8&gt;Koop &amp; Schmolke, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 1940, ''Leberecht Maass'' and five other destroyers, Z3 ''Max Schultz'', Z4 ''Richard Beitzen'', {{ship|German destroyer|Z6 Theodor Riedel||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z13 Erich Koellner||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt||2}}, sailed for the [[Dogger Bank]] to intercept British fishing vessels in &quot;[[Operation Wikinger]]&quot;. En route, the flotilla was erroneously attacked by a [[Heinkel He 111]] bomber from ''[[Kampfgeschwader 26|KG 26]]''. ''Leberecht Maass'' was hit by at least one bomb, lost steering, and broke in half, sinking with the loss of 280 of her crew, among them the ship's commanding officer, ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' Fritz Bassenge.

The '''German destroyer Z3 ''Max Schultz''''' was a [[Type 1934 destroyer]] built for the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' in the mid-1930s. Shortly before the beginning of World War II, the ship accidentally [[ramming|rammed]] and sank a German [[torpedo boat]]. ''Max Schultz'' spent the following month under repair. In mid-February 1940, while proceeding into the [[North Sea]] to search for British [[fishing trawler]]s, one of her [[sister ship|sisters]], {{ship|German destroyer|Z1 Leberecht Maass||2}}, was bombed and sunk by a patrolling German [[bomber]]. While trying to rescue survivors, ''Max Schultz'' struck a British [[Naval mine|mine]] and sank with all hands.

==Design and description==
''Max Schultz'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|119|m|ftin|sp=us}} and was {{convert|114|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length at the waterline|long at the waterline]]. The ship had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|11.30|m|ftin|sp=us}}, and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.23|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She displaced {{convert|2223|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard load]] and {{convert|3156|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The two Wagner geared [[steam turbine]] sets, each driving one [[propeller shaft]], were designed to produce {{convert|70000|PS|kW shp|lk=on|abbr=on}} using steam provided by six high-pressure Wagner [[boiler]]s. The ship had a designed speed of {{convert|36|kn|link=on}}, but her maximum speed was {{convert|38.7|kn}}.&lt;ref name=g9&gt;Gröner, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; ''Max Schultz'' carried a maximum of {{convert|752|t|LT|0|sp=us}} of [[fuel oil]] which was intended to give a range of {{convert|4400|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|19|kn}}, but the ship proved top-heavy in service and 30% of the fuel had to be retained as [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] low in the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The effective range proved to be only {{convert|1530|nmi|abbr=on}} at 19 knots.&lt;ref&gt;Koop &amp; Schmolke, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship carried five [[12.7 cm SK C/34 naval gun|12.7 cm SK C/34 guns]] in single mounts with [[gun shield]]s, two each [[superfire|superimposed]], fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the aft [[superstructure]]. Her [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] armament consisted of four [[3.7 cm SK C/30]] guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] and six [[2 cm FlaK 30/38/Flakvierling|2 cm C/30]] guns in single mounts. ''Max Schultz'' carried eight above-water {{convert|53.3|cm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s in two power-operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount.&lt;ref name=g9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Four [[depth charge]] throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 [[naval mine|mine]]s.&lt;ref name=g9/&gt; A system of passive [[hydrophone]]s designated as 'GHG' (''[[Gruppenhorchgerät]]'') was fitted to detect [[submarine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; The crew numbered 10 officers and 315 enlisted men, plus an additional four officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a [[flotilla]] [[flagship]].&lt;ref name=g9/&gt;

==Construction and career==
The ship was ordered on 7 July 1934 and [[Keel|laid down]] at [[Deutsche Werke]], [[Kiel]], on 2 January 1935 as yard number K244. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 30 November 1935 and completed on 8 April 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; She was named after [[Max Schultz]] who commanded the torpedo boat {{SMS|V69||2}} and was killed in action in January 1917.&lt;ref name=ks7&gt;Koop &amp; Schmolke, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korvettenkapitän]] [[Martin Balzer]] was appointed as her first [[captain (nautical)|captain]]. ''Max Schultz'' was assigned to the 1st Destroyer Division on 26 October 1937&lt;ref name=ks7/&gt; and made a port visit to [[Ulvik]], [[Norway]] in April 1938, together with her sisters  {{ship|German destroyer|Z2 Georg Thiele||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z4 Richard Beitzen||2}}. Upon her return she was taken in hand by Deutsche Werke to have her bow rebuilt to reduce the amount of water that came over the bow in [[head sea]]s. This increased her length by {{convert|.3|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The ship participated in the August [[Fleet Review]] and the following fleet exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; In December, ''Max Schultz'', together with her sisters ''Leberecht Maass'', ''Georg Thiele'', and ''Richard Beitzen'', sailed to the area of [[Iceland]] to evaluate their seaworthiness in a [[North Atlantic]] winter with their new bows. On 23–24 March 1939, the ship was one of the destroyers that escorted [[Adolf Hitler]] aboard the [[pocket battleship]] {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}} to [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|occupy Memel]].&lt;ref name=ks7/&gt; She participated in the Spring fleet exercise in the western Mediterranean, as the flagship of Rear Admiral [[Günther Lütjens]], and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Days before the outbreak of [[World War II]], in the early morning hours of 27 August 1939, the destroyer accidentally collided with and sank the torpedo boat ''[[German torpedo boat Tiger (1928)|Tiger]]'' near [[Bornholm]]. Two men were killed and six were wounded aboard the torpedo boat, while no one was injured aboard ''Max Schultz''. The latter's bow was severely damaged and she had to be towed, stern-first, by Z2 ''Georg Thiele''. Two tugboats arrived a half-hour later and took over the tow to [[Swinemünde]] at a speed of {{convert|4|kn}}. ''Max Schultz'' was under repair until late September and did not participate in the [[Polish Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;
 
She patrolled the [[Skagerrak]] to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods during October. While returning from one such patrol on 28 October, one of the ship's turbines exploded, causing boiler room No. 1 to flood and knocking out the ship's power. Attempts to tow her failed, but the ship eventually managed to restore power and she sailed to Kiel for repairs.&lt;ref name=ks7/&gt; ''Max Schultz'', ''Beitzen'' and {{ship|German destroyer|Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt||2}} laid 110 magnetic mines in the Shipwash area, off Harwich, on 9/10 February 1940 that sank six ships of {{GRT|28,496|disp=long}} and damaged another.&lt;ref&gt;Hervieux, pp. 113–14&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February, ''Max Schultz'' and five other destroyers, Z1 ''Leberecht Maass'', Z4 ''Richard Beitzen'', {{ship|German destroyer|Z6 Theodor Riedel||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z13 Erich Koellner||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt||2}}, sailed for the [[Dogger Bank]] to intercept British fishing vessels in &quot;[[Operation Wikinger]]&quot;. En route, the flotilla was erroneously attacked by a [[Heinkel He 111]] bomber from Bomber Wing ''([[Kampfgeschwader]])'' 26. ''Leberecht Maass'' was hit by at least one bomb, lost steering, and broke in half, sinking with the loss of 280 of her crew. During the rescue effort, ''Max Schultz'' hit a mine and sank with the loss of her entire crew of 308. Hitler ordered a [[Court of Inquiry (Naval)|Court of Inquiry]] to be convened to investigate the cause of the losses and it concluded that both ships that been sunk by bombs from the He 111. The Kriegsmarine had failed to notify its destroyers that the Luftwaffe was making anti-shipping patrols at that time and had also failed to inform the Luftwaffe that its destroyers would be at sea.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Postwar evidence revealed that one or both ships struck a British minefield laid by the destroyers {{HMS|Ivanhoe|D16|2}} and {{HMS|Intrepid|D10|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''U-557''''' was a [[German Type VIIC submarine|Type VIIC]] [[U-boat]] built for [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' for service during [[World War II]]. She was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 6 January 1940, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 22 December 1940 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 13 February 1941. ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' Ottokar Paulssen was in command throughout her career. For her first three war patrols her 2nd Watch Officer was [[Herbert Werner]], who later wrote the memoir of U-boat service, ''[[Iron Coffins]]''. She sank six merchant ships and one warship, a total of almost {{GRT|37000|disp=long}} over four patrols.&lt;ref name=&quot;uboatnet&quot; /&gt;

She was rammed and sunk by mistake by an Italian torpedo boat on 16 December 1941 west of [[Crete]].

==Design==
[[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIC|German Type VIIC submarines]] were preceded by the shorter [[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIB|Type VIIB submarines]]. ''U-557'' had a displacement of {{convert|769|t|LT}} when at the surface and {{convert|871|t|LT}} while submerged.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}} She had a total length of {{convert|67.10|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[pressure hull]] length of {{convert|50.50|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|6.20|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a height of {{convert|9.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a [[draught (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|4.74|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The submarine was powered by two [[Germaniawerft]] F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder [[supercharged]] [[diesel engine]]s producing a total of {{convert|2800 to 3200|PS|kW shp|-1}} for use while surfaced, two [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie]] GG UB 720/8 [[Motor–generator|double-acting electric motors]] producing a total of {{convert|750|PS|kW shp}} for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two {{convert|1.23|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} [[propeller]]s. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to {{convert|230|m}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}}

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of {{convert|17.7|kn}} and a maximum submerged speed of {{convert|7.6|kn}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}} When submerged, the boat could operate for {{convert|80|nmi}} at {{convert|4|kn}}; when surfaced, she could travel {{convert|8500|nmi}} at {{convert|10|kn}}. ''U-557'' was fitted with five {{convert|53.3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen [[torpedo]]es, one [[8.8 cm SK C/35 naval gun|{{convert|8.8|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} SK C/35 naval gun]], 220 rounds, and an anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a [[Ship's company|complement]] of between forty-four and sixty.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}}

==Service history==

===Emergency in the Baltic===
''U-557'' commissioned in February 1941, and was assigned to [[1st U-boat flotilla]], then based at [[Kiel]]. She spent the next four months at [[Königsberg]], working up in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. During this period she suffered a diving accident, during which one crewman died.&lt;ref name=U557&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://uboat.net/boats/u557.htm
 |title=The Type VIIC Uboat U-557
 |last=Helgason
 |first=Guðmundur
 |website=German U-boats of WWII - uboat.net
 |accessdate=28 December 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Werner describes this incident graphically in his book: He tells us that 
a routine dive in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] turned into an emergency when the boat sank out of control. She hit the bottom stern-first with a thump. The depth gauge read {{convert|142|m|ft|abbr=on}}; the submarine was in severe difficulty, having taken on tons of water, poisonous chlorine gas was leaking from the batteries and there was the danger of an explosion. ''U-557'' had also suffered her first death; a mechanic sustained fatal head injuries in the after torpedo room. A human chain of sailors was formed, passing buckets of sea water to each other, in an attempt to shift some of the weight from the stern to the bow. After many hour's toil, the boat pivoted so that the bow hit the bottom. But the sheer weight of water (about 40 tons) prevented ''U-557'' from reaching the surface. The boat, having exhausted its supply of compressed air, stayed on the sea bed. The crew, under the direction of the Chief Engineer, rocked the boat by moving rapidly from stern to bow and back again. The submarine eventually worked herself free. After 20 hours, ''U-557'' surfaced and sailed on to Kiel.&lt;ref&gt;Werner pp. 16-19&lt;/ref&gt;

===First patrol===
''U-557'' departed from Kiel on 13 May 1941 to take up station in the Atlantic.&lt;ref name=U557firstpatrol&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_1297.html
 |title=''U-557'' first patrol
 |last=Helgason
 |first=Guðmundur
 |website=German U-boats of WWII - uboat.net
 |accessdate=28 December 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 24 May her captain was directed to support [[Operation Rheinübung|the sortie]] by battleship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} and join a five boat patrol line west of the French coast to form a trap for units of the British [[Home Fleet]], which were in pursuit as ''Bismarck'' fled towards the French coast.&lt;ref&gt;Blair p288&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their efforts the trap failed and ''Bismarck'' was attacked and sunk on 27 May. 
The Home Fleet had been able to [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|track down and destroy ''Bismarck'']] without hindrance from the U-boat Arm.&lt;ref&gt;Blair pp. 289-292&lt;/ref&gt;

The trap was dissolved and ''U-557'' was directed to join [[Wolfpack West|patrol line ''West'']], searching for North Atlantic convoys.
However the ''Bismarck'' operation had disrupted U-boat operations and only two ships sunk in latter two weeks of May; one of these was ''Empire Storm'', sunk by ''U-557'' on 29 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blair p293&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June ''U-557'' re-fuelled from supply ship ''Belchen'', but later that same day ''Belchen'' was caught and sunk by Royal Navy units [[Operation Rheinübung#Aftermath|engaged in hunting down]] the Operation ''Rheinübung'' supply train.&lt;ref&gt;Blair p299&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June ''U-557'' joined Group ''West'', but the group had no success; this period following the [[Operation Primrose|capture of ''U-110'']] and the consequent [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|penetration of German Enigma code]] meant the [[Western Allies|Allies]] were able to re-route threatened convoys around areas of known U-boat activity and losses were kept to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Blair p305&lt;/ref&gt;

''U 557'' abandoned her patrol after six relatively fruitless weeks, arriving at [[Lorient]] on 10 July.&lt;ref name=U557firstpatrol/&gt;

===Second patrol===
''U-557'' sailed on her second war patrol on 13 August 1941, though she returned two days later (reason unknown), sailing again on 20 August to take position south of Iceland.&lt;ref name=U557secondpatrol&gt;{{cite web

On 24 August ''U-557'' found and reported [[convoy OS 4]] and commenced shadowing. As reinforcements arrived, Paulssen was permitted to attack; he made three approaches, sinking four ships in total.&lt;ref&gt;Blair p339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven other U-boats joined the assault, but only one other had any success. ''U-557'' continued to shadow, but had no further success, and on 28 August the attack was called off.
On 28 August ''U-557'' joined the [[Wolfpack Bosemuller|''Bosemuller'']] patrol line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Neither had any success and on 15 September ''U-557'' was ordered to return, arriving at Lorient on 19 September.&lt;ref name=U557secondpatrol/&gt;

===Third patrol===
On 19 November 1941 ''U-557'' sailed from Lorient bound for the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name=U557thirdpatrol&gt;{{cite web

Werner had been reassigned and had left the boat at this point.&lt;ref&gt;Werner p68&lt;/ref&gt;
On 25/26 November she successfully penetrated the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], despite Allied [[Anti-submarine warfare|ASW]] patrols, and on 2 December sank the freighter ''Fjord'' off [[Estepona|Cape Estepona]], [[Spain]]. This caused some controversy, as a subsequent investigation showed this attack had infringed Spanish neutrality, taking took place within Spanish territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''U-557'' arrived at [[Messina]] on 7 December 1941.&lt;ref name=U557thirdpatrol/&gt;

News of this sinking even reached the Submarine Tracking Room in London.&lt;ref&gt;Gannon, Michael - ''Operation Drumbeat - the dramatic true story of Germany's first U-boat attacks along the American coast in World War II'', 1990, Harper and Row publishers, ISBN 0-06-016155-8, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate==
At 1806hrs on 16 December, ''U-557'' sent a short radio signal indicating that she was 18 hours from port. At 1800hrs on the same day, the Italian torpedo boat ''Orione'' left the Cretan port of [[Suda]]. The commander had no knowledge that a German U-boat was in the area of Crete.

When the Italian commander saw a submarine at 2144hrs, heading in a northerly direction, he decided to ram it, supposing it to be British. ''U-557'' sank immediately with all hands; the damaged Italian torpedo boat headed back to base. The position of the incident was given by the Italian commander as {{coord|35.31|N|23.19|E|type:landmark|display=inline,title}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;uboatnet&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;ref&gt;Niestle p69&lt;/ref&gt;
An investigation by ''Supermarina'' (Italian Naval Command) determined the collision was an accident, though they reserved judgement on whether the ramming was intended, or the result of a navigational error.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp p75&lt;/ref&gt; They also noted that German notification of ''U-557''{{'s}} presence in the area did not arrive with ''Supermarina'' until 2200hrs, after the incident had taken place.&lt;ref name=U557/&gt;

The '''Imber [[friendly fire|friendly fire incident]]''' took place on the 13 April 1942 at [[Imber]], [[England]], during the [[Second World War]]. One of the [[Royal Air Force]] fighter aircraft taking part in a firepower demonstration accidentally opened fire on a crowd of spectators, killing 25 and wounding 71. Pilot error and bad weather were blamed for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-17692313 |title=Memorial plaque for 25 WWII 'friendly fire' victims |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
[[Image:Hawker Sea Hurricanes.jpg|thumb|Six Hawker Hurricane similar to the aircraft involved]] 
On 13 April 1942 the weather was hazy and six Royal Air Force (RAF) [[Hawker Hurricane]]s from [[No. 175 Squadron RAF]] and six [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s from [[No. 234 Squadron RAF]] were being used for a demonstration of tactical airpower at [[Imber]], a [[British Army]] [[Salisbury Plain#Army Training Estate Salisbury Plain|training ground]] on [[Salisbury Plain]] in  [[Wiltshire]].  The event was a dress rehearsal for an upcoming visit by [[Winston Churchill]] and General [[George Marshall]], [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Lost&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7REOAQAAMAAJ|title=The Lost Villages: In Search of Britain's Vanished Communities|first=Henry|last=Buckton|year=2008|page=156|isbn=978-1-84511-671-2|publisher=I.B. Tauris}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended by a number of military personnel. The Spitfires overflew followed by the Hurricanes. Five of the Hurricanes hit the correct targets: several armoured vehicles and mock tanks. The pilot of the sixth Hurricane opened fire at the spectators before continuing with the demonstration. Casualties were {{nowrap|25 military}} personnel killed and  {{nowrap|71 wounded.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorial to be unveiled to personnel killed in Imber friendly fire incident |date=11 April 2012 |url=

The following day the [[War Office]] and [[Air Ministry]] issued a joint statement:
{{quote|During combined excercises to-day in Southern England there was an unfortunate accident in which a number of soldiers, including some members of the Home Guard, were killed and other injured. The next-of-kin have been informed.&lt;ref name=&quot;times4&quot;&gt;&quot;News in Brief.&quot; ''Times'' [London, England] 14 April 1942: 4. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 21 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

First reports were that 14 had died with forty to fifty injured but this was later revised to 23 killed on the day (16 officers and seven soldiers). Four of the officers were members of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;times4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Combined Exercises Accident.&quot; ''Times'' [London, England] 15 Apr. 1942: 4.

Web. 21 Sept. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Two other officers died from wounds in the next few days, one on the 14 April the other (a Home Guard officer) on the 15 April to bring the total deaths to 25.

==Inquiry==
The Court of Inquiry found the pilot, 21-year-old Sergeant William McLachlan was guilty of making an error of judgement and that the weather at the time contributed to the incident. The pilot of the Hurricane had misidentified the spectators as dummies, thinking that they were part of the demonstration when he opened fire.

An inquest held at Warminster into the 27 deaths{{#tag:ref|The Times report contradicts other sources that give the total deaths at 25.|group=N}} recorded that the deaths were caused by gunshot wounds and attributed to misadventure. The RAF pilot told the inquest he lost sight of the aeroplane he was following in the haze and realised he had made a mistake after he fired. The coroner also pointed out that, contrary to rumour, the pilot was British and not American.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;News in Brief - Pilot who fired at Spectators.&quot; Times [London, England] 27 June 1942: 2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4777">'''Operation ''Wikinger''''' ({{lang-de|[[Viking]]}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/articles/feature4.html Operation ''Wikinger'']&lt;/ref&gt; was a sortie into the [[North Sea]] by [[German World War II destroyers]] (1st Destroyer Flotilla) of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', in February 1940. During this operation, poor inter-service communication and cooperation between the ''Kriegsmarine'' and the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and inexperience resulted in the loss of two German ships through [[friendly fire]] bombing and German or British mines. No Allied forces were involved.

==Background==
On February 1940, the ''Kriegsmarine'' had grown suspicious of the activities of British [[fishing trawler|fishing vessels]] around the [[Dogger Bank]]. ''Luftwaffe'' reconnaissance flights reported the presence of submarines, so it was decided to intercept the British vessels with the six destroyers of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla: [[German destroyer Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt|''Friedrich Eckoldt'']] (flotilla leader), [[German destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen|''Richard Beitzen'']], [[German destroyer Z13 Erich Koellner|''Erich Koellner'']], [[German destroyer Z6 Theodor Riedel|''Theodor Riedel'']], [[German destroyer Z3 Max Schultz|''Max Schultz'']] and [[German destroyer Z1 Leberecht Maass|''Leberecht Maass'']], escorted by ''Luftwaffe'' fighters.

At about the same time, ''[[10th Air Corps (Germany)|X. Fliegerkorps]]'' of the ''Luftwaffe'' planned to execute a postponed anti-shipping operation over the [[North Sea]], using two squadrons of [[Heinkel He 111|Heinkel 111]] bombers.

The ''Kriegsmarine'' had been denied its own air wing (&quot;''Marineflieger''&quot;) and was dependent upon the ''Luftwaffe'' for air support, which remained under direct Luftwaffe control. Exchanges of information and plans and requests for support had to traverse a lengthy command chain.

==Execution==
[[File:Leberecht Maass2.jpg|thumb|''[[German destroyer Z1 Leberecht Maass|Z 1 Leberecht Maass]]'']]
The sortie began at 19:00 on 19 February 1940. The flotilla proceeded at high speed through a cleared channel between German defensive minefields, without the fighter air cover that had been requested. In the sea and weather conditions they were clearly visible, from their wakes, but they wished to clear the mined area quickly.

The flotilla was passed twice by a German bomber, which was uncertain of the ships' status. It made no recognition signals and, as a result, it was taken to be a British reconnaissance aircraft and fired upon by the ships. Fire was returned by the aircrew. Each side was now convinced of the other's hostility.

The German aircraft attacked. On the first bombing run, one of three bombs hit ''Leberecht Maass''. While the rest of the flotilla was ordered to continue in formation, ''Friedrich Eckoldt'' went alongside ready to help. The Heinkel made a second run and two bombs hit ''Leberecht Maass'', which was broken in two by large explosions. The bomber returned to its base, unaware, until then, of the other ships in the flotilla.

Immediately after the explosions, the remainder of the flotilla attempted to rescue the crew. Just after 20:00, ''Max Schultz'' exploded and sank, probably striking a mine. What followed was confusion. There were many erroneous reports of air attack, submarines detected and torpedoes; ships dashed back and forth. ''Theodor Riedel'' dropped depth charges on a supposed submarine and the explosions temporarily jammed its rudder.

After 30 minutes of action, the flotilla commander ordered the surviving four ships to return home. There were no survivors from ''Max Schultz'' and only 60 from ''Leberecht Maass'': in all, 578 German sailors died.

==Aftermath==
The initial view of the naval command in [[Wilhelmshaven]] — ''Marinegruppe'' West — was that the flotilla had run into a German minefield. The presence of enemy submarines was discounted. At 23:00, naval command received a report from ''[[10th Air Corps (Germany)|X. Fliegerkorps]]'' that a ship had been engaged and destroyed in the general area of the sinkings, at the same time. Subsequent reports appeared to confirm the &quot;friendly fire&quot; attack.

Neither the destroyers nor the ''Luftwaffe'' squadrons had been told of the other's presence, although information had been passed to the relevant commands. By the time the risks became apparent, it was too late to advise aircrews.

The official German investigation showed that there had been inadequate communication between the ''Luftwaffe'' and the ''Kriegsmarine''. None of the responsible officers were called to account.

'''USS ''Albert W. Grant'' (DD-649)''' was a {{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer|0}} [[destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. She was the only ship named for [[Vice Admiral]] [[Albert W. Grant]] (1856–1930), an [[admiral]] during [[World War I]].

''Albert W. Grant'' was laid down on 30 December 1942 at [[North Charleston, South Carolina]], by the [[Charleston Navy Yard]]; [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 29 May 1943, sponsored by Miss Nell Preston Grant, granddaughter of Admiral Grant; and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 24 November 1943, [[Commander]] T. A. Nisewaner in command. That day, the destroyer departed Charleston Navy Yard for a [[shakedown cruise]] to [[Bermuda]] and returned to Charleston Navy Yard on 29 January 1944 for minor alterations.

==Service history==

===1944===
''Albert W. Grant'' headed for [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on 8 February, and five days later, she got underway to escort {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|2}} to [[Hawaii]]. They transited the [[Panama Canal]], joined more ships at [[San Diego]], and finally arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]] on 4 March.

On 4 April, the destroyer sailed for [[Majuro]] where she joined [[Task Force 58|TF 58]] for the [[Operation Reckless|invasion at Hollandia]]. During that [[New Guinea]] operation, from 21 to 29 April, ''Grant'' engaged in picket duty, inshore patrol duty, and covered landing force operations. On 29 April, she headed for the [[Caroline Islands]] with [[Task Group 58.3|TG 58.3]] and screened the carriers during strikes on [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]]. The task group left for Majuro on 2 May and continued on to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 11 May.

====Marianas, Palaus and Philippines campaigns====
After a brief respite, ''Albert W. Grant'' got underway on 29 May for [[Eniwetok]], which served as the [[staging area]] for the invasion of the [[Marianas Islands|Marianas]]. On 11 June, she sailed to [[Saipan]] and commenced her gunfire support activities on 15 June. The destroyer was also involved in action against [[Tinian]]. She departed the Saipan area on 29 July and put in to Eniwetok on 2 August. Following a brief upkeep period, the destroyer got underway for [[Purvis Bay]], [[Solomon Islands]], on 22 August.

The ship sortied with [[Task Group 32.5|TG 32.5]] on 6 September for the [[Palau Islands campaign|assault on the Palaus]] and, during a two-week period in mid-September, conducted pre-invasion bombardment and supported the landings [[Battle of Peleliu|on Peleliu]] and [[Battle of Angaur|Angaur]]. On 29 September, she left for [[Manus Island]]. The destroyer remained there through 12 October, then sailed for the [[Philippines]] as a member of [[Task Group 77.2|TG 77.2]]. On 17 October, ''Grant'' provided protection for {{USS|Crosby|APD-17|2}} while that [[fast transport]] landed troops on [[Suluan Island]], Philippines. From 17 to 24 October, the destroyer provided fire support for the [[Battle of Leyte|assault on Leyte]].

====Leyte Gulf====
On 24 October, ''Albert W. Grant'' joined TG 77.2 and sailed to engage a [[Japan]]ese task force reported steaming northward from the [[Sulu Sea]] toward [[Surigao Strait]]. That American [[battleship]] group met the Japanese force in the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]], and ''Grant'', along with other destroyers in advance of the main battle line, conducted a [[torpedo]] attack. During this attack, she was hit and severely damaged by gunfire, not only Japanese naval forces, but also by its covering US battleships. ''Grant'' suffered 22 hits, many by six-inch shells. Fires broke out, and the ship lost steering control and all power. Thirty-eight men were killed and 104 were wounded. Although their ship was down by the bow and listing heavily to port, the destroyer's crew got her engines working again and enabled her to retire to American-controlled waters in [[Leyte Gulf]].

While en route to [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]], ''Grant'' weathered a [[typhoon]] before reaching the anchorage. Following temporary repairs, the ship sailed for Pearl Harbor on 30 October under tow by {{USS|Hidatsa|AT-102|2}}. She stopped en route at [[Seeadler Harbor]] and [[Majuro]]. ''Grant'' reached Pearl Harbor on 29 November and, three days later, sailed for [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard|Mare Island]], [[California]]. Following her arrival on 9 December, the destroyer underwent major repair work.

===1945===
''Albert W. Grant'' left the shipyard on 11 March 1945 and headed for Pearl Harbor. She arrived there on 25 March and began underway training exercises. On 23 April, the destroyer sailed for the Philippines. ''Grant'' reached Leyte on 13 May. She stood out of [[Manila]] on 3 June to escort [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]], embarked in {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}}, on a tour of the Philippines. ''Grant'' then sailed southwest toward [[Brunei Bay]], [[Borneo]], to rendezvous with [[Task Group 78.1|TG 78.1]] for the [[Operation Oboe Six|assault on Brunei Bay]]. On 10 June, she covered the landings there. The ship rejoined the MacArthur tour on the 11th and dropped anchor at [[Manila]] on 15 June.

''Grant'' operated in [[Manila Bay]] until 27 June, when she got underway for [[Balikpapan]], [[Borneo]]. From 30 June to 9 July, the destroyer covered [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|operations against Balikpapan]]. She was back at Manila on 14 July. ''Grant'' then moved to the [[Marshall Islands|Marshalls]] and, upon her arrival at Eniwetok on 3 August, joined [[Task Force 49|TF 49]] for duty in the North Pacific. She sailed to [[Adak, Alaska]], and the day before she arrived there, received word of the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese capitulation]] on 15 August, and sortied with TF 49 for [[Ominato]], Japan. The task force arrived off [[Honshū]] on 8 September and anchored at Ominato on the 10th.

The destroyer remained on occupation duty in Japan through mid-November. ''Grant'' then sailed back to the [[United States]]. She arrived at [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], on 2 December, and upon her arrival, began overhaul. The destroyer was placed out of commission, in reserve at San Diego, on 16 July 1946. Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy list]] on 14 April 1971, and she was sold for scrapping.

'''German submarine ''U-235''''' was a [[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIC|Type VIIC]] [[U-boat]] of [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during [[World War II]].

==Design==
[[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIC|German Type VIIC submarines]] were preceded by the shorter [[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIB|Type VIIB submarines]]. ''U-235'' had a displacement of {{convert|769|t|LT}} when at the surface and {{convert|871|t|LT}} while submerged.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}} She had a total length of {{convert|67.10|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[pressure hull]] length of {{convert|50.50|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|6.20|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a height of {{convert|9.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a [[draught (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|4.74|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The submarine was powered by two [[Germaniawerft]] F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder [[supercharged]] [[diesel engine]]s producing a total of {{convert|2800 to 3200|PS|kW shp|-1}} for use while surfaced, two [[AEG]] GU 460/8–27 [[Motor–generator|double-acting electric motors]] producing a total of {{convert|750|PS|kW shp}} for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two {{convert|1.23|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} [[propeller]]s. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to {{convert|230|m}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}}

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of {{convert|17.7|kn}} and a maximum submerged speed of {{convert|7.6|kn}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}} When submerged, the boat could operate for {{convert|80|nmi}} at {{convert|4|kn}}; when surfaced, she could travel {{convert|8500|nmi}} at {{convert|10|kn}}. ''U-235'' was fitted with five {{convert|53.3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen [[torpedo]]es, one [[8.8 cm SK C/35 naval gun|{{convert|8.8|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} SK C/35 naval gun]], 220 rounds, and an anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a [[Ship's company|complement]] of between forty-four and sixty.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}}

==Service history==
The submarine was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 25 February 1942 at the [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft]] yard at [[Kiel]] as yard number 665, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 4 November and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 19 December under the command of ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' Goske von Möllendorf.&lt;ref name=uboatnet/&gt;

After training with the [[5th U-boat Flotilla]] at Kiel, ''U-235'' was transferred to the [[22nd U-boat Flotilla|22nd flotilla]] on 29 October 1943, following her sinking in May by US bombs in Kiel. She had been raised, repaired and returned to service. She was reassigned to the [[31st U-boat Flotilla]] on 2 April 1945, less than two weeks before her second sinking.

''U-235'' was sunk in error in April 1945 in the [[Kattegat]] by a German torpedo boat.

==Loss==
''U-235'' was heading to Norway with {{GS|U-1272||2}} when they encountered a small German convoy accompanied by the torpedo boat ''T-17''. All vessels had not been warned of the others' presence. But the convoy had been warned that a British submarine was in the area. ''U-1272'' dived deep and out of trouble, but ''U-235'' surfaced, possibly to identify herself and then as if changing her mind, also dived. ''T-17'' attacked, dropping [[depth charge]]s. Any celebration on ''T-17'' was abruptly stilled when amongst the wreckage appearing were bodies in ''Kriegsmarine'' uniform.{{sfn|Kemp|1999|p=249}} Forty-six men died; there were no survivors.&lt;ref name=uboatnet/&gt;

'''USS ''Seawolf'' (SS-197)''', a [[Sargo class submarine|''Sargo''-class submarine]], was the second [[submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]] named for the [[Atlantic wolffish|seawolf]].

Her keel was laid down on 27 September 1938 by the [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]] in [[Kittery, Maine]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 15 August 1939 sponsored by Mrs. Syria Florence Kalbfus, wife of Admiral [[Edward C. Kalbfus]] and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 1 December 1939, Lieutenant [[Frederick B. Warder]] (Class of 1925) in command.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===
After fitting out, ''Seawolf'' departed [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] on 12 April 1940 for her shakedown cruise, which lasted until 21 June and took her as far south as the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. ''Seawolf'' was next assigned to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], home ported at San Diego. In the autumn of 1940, she proceeded to [[Manila Bay]] and operated from the [[Cavite Navy Yard]].

===World War II===
When war with Japan began, the submarine readied for sea and was on her first war patrol from 8–26 December 1941.

''Seawolf'' hunted Japanese shipping off [[San Bernardino Strait]]. On 14 December, she fired a spread of torpedoes at ''Sanyo Maru'' in [[Port San Vicente]]. One torpedo hit, but did not explode.&lt;ref name=USNChron1941&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/USN-Chron/|title=The official chronology of the U.S. Navy in World War II|chapter=Chapter III: 1941|chapterurl=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/USN-Chron/USN-Chron-1941.html|first=Robert|last =Cressman|location=Annapolis, Maryland|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2000|isbn=978-1-55750-149-3|oclc=41977179|accessdate=2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She promptly underwent her first [[depth charge]] attack but suffered no damage.

''Seawolf'' departed [[Manila]] on 31 December 1941 for Australia and arrived at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] on 9 January 1942. She loaded 30–40 tons of .50-caliber (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) antiaircraft ammunition for use by American forces on [[Corregidor]] and sailed for [[Manila Bay]] on 16 January. The submarine sighted seven Japanese freighters accompanied by four [[destroyer]]s and a [[cruiser]] on 21 January, but had no opportunity to fire any of the eight torpedoes that she had aboard. The ammunition was unloaded on 28–29 January at Corregidor. ''Seawolf'' then loaded torpedoes and passengers, and headed for [[Surabaya]], [[Java (island)|Java]].

''Seawolf'' sailed out of Surabaya on 15 February and began patrolling in the [[Java Sea]]-[[Lombok Strait]] area. On 19 February, she fired four torpedoes at two Japanese freighter-transports in the [[Badung Strait]]. Damage to one was not ascertained, but the other was reported last seen down by the stern and listing to starboard. (However, ''Sagami Maru'' had been damaged by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] air attack, not by ''Seawolf''{{'}}s torpedo.)

A week later, she fired her stern tubes at a freighter and watched one hit forward of the bridge before going deep to evade depth charges from an escorting destroyer at which she had also fired. In March, ''Seawolf'' was hunting between Java and [[Christmas Island]]. On 1 April, she stealthily approached the anchorage at Christmas Island where the [[Battle of Christmas Island|Japanese invasion force]] lay at anchor. ''Seawolf'' fired a spread at {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Naka||2}}. Though ''Seawolf'' was credited with a sinking at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Clay, Jr. ''Silent Victory'' (Bantam, 1976), p.191&lt;/ref&gt; only one torpedo hit, causing significant damage to the ship, although not harming any of the crew.  ''Naka'' was forced to return to Japan for repairs and was out of the war for almost a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hara|first=Tameichi|year=1961|title=Japanese Destroyer Captain|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|oclc=1070440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unaware she had hit her target, ''Seawolf'' then underwent 7½ hours of depth charge attacks. On 1 April, she attacked two [[cruiser]]s. A violent explosion was heard, but no flames were seen. ''Seawolf'' ended her patrol on 7 April at [[Fremantle]] and received the [[Navy Unit Commendation]].

On her fifth patrol, from 12 May until 2 July (a total of 51 days at sea),&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p.911.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Seawolf'' patrolled the [[Philippine Islands]] area. She attacked freighters on 20 May 23 May, 12 June 13 June 15 June, and 28 June. On 13 June, she fired at two ships and her crew heard four explosions, but  no sinkings were confirmed. ''Seawolf'' returned to Fremantle for three weeks before beginning her sixth war patrol.

''Seawolf'' prowled the [[Sulu Sea]] and [[Celebes Sea]] from 25 July – 15 September. She attacked a tanker on 3 August, sank ''Hachigen Maru'' on 14 August and ''Showa Maru'' 11 days later. She returned to Fremantle to refit and then hunted in the [[Davao Gulf]] area from 7 October – 1 December. ''Seawolf'' sank ''Gifu Maru'' on 2 November, ''Sagami Maru'' the next day, and ''Keiko Maru'' on 8 November. She ended her patrol at [[Pearl Harbor]], where Lieutenant Commander Royce Lawrence Gross relieved Commander Warder.&lt;ref&gt;http://navsource.org/archives/08/pdf/0819733.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  She then proceeded to the West Coast.

''Seawolf'' arrived at [[Mare Island]] on 10 December 1942 and underwent an overhaul that lasted until 24 February 1943. She returned to [[Pearl Harbor]] on 13 March, and on 3 April stood out for another patrol. She ended this patrol early, on 3 May, because she had expended all torpedoes on enemy shipping near the [[Bonin Islands|Bonin]] Islands. On 15 April, she torpedoed ''Kaihei Maru'', sank an old [[destroyer]] now known as ''Patrol Boat Number 39'' on 23 April; and sank two 75-ton [[sampan]]s with her 3-in (76mm) gun.

''Seawolf'' returned to [[Midway Island]] for refitting and departed that island on 17 May and headed for the [[East China Sea]]. She ran into several large convoys as she prowled from [[Taiwan|Formosa]] to [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. The submarine tracked a convoy of 11 ships and fired a spread of torpedoes at a large freighter on 6 June. One torpedo hit the target but proved to be a dud, and another passed under the freighter and hit an escort. Two weeks later, she fired a spread at four ships. One was hit in the stern and sank in approximately nine minutes. This was ''Shojin Maru'' loaded with troops. ''Seawolf'' returned to Midway Island on 8 July and, four days later, steamed into [[Pearl Harbor]].

Her next patrol was from 14 August – 15 September. This patrol, in the East China Sea, was also ended prematurely due to firing all torpedoes. She sank 12,996 tons of enemy shipping, excluding two 75-ton sampans sunk by shellfire. ''Seawolf'' made contact with a six-ship convoy on her third day in the patrol area. She attacked day and night for three days before finally surfacing to sink ''Fusei Maru'' with her deck gun.

On ''Seawolf''{{'}}s 11th patrol, in the [[South China Sea]] from 5 October – 27 November, she sank ''Wuhu Maru'', ''Kaifuku Maru'', and damaged a 10,000-ton cargo ship. The submarine refitted at [[Pearl Harbor]], and on 22 December 1943, headed for the [[East China Sea]] on what was to be her most lucrative patrol. She attacked a seven-ship convoy on the night of 10–11 January 1944 and sank three ships totaling 19,710 tons.

On 14 January, ''Seawolf'' fired her last four torpedoes at two merchant ships in a convoy, damaging one and sinking ''Yamatsuru Maru''. She continued tracking the convoy while radioing its position to {{USS|Whale|SS-239|2}}. ''Whale'' arrived on 16 January and promptly attacked, damaging one ship and sinking ''Denmark Maru''. The next morning, ''Whale'' damaged another before action was broken off.

''Seawolf'' returned to Pearl Harbor on 27 January and sailed for San Francisco two days later. After undergoing a major overhaul at [[Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco|Hunters Point]], the submarine headed west on 16 May, with Lieutenant Commander Richard Barr Lynch in command. When she reached [[Pearl Harbor]], she was assigned the task of photographing [[Peleliu Island]] in the [[Palau Islands]], in preparation for the forthcoming attack on that stronghold. She carried out this mission despite constant enemy air patrols from 4 June – 7 July.

The submarine headed to [[Majuro]] for voyage repairs and was rerouted to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. There, she received orders sending her on a special mission to [[Tawitawi]], in the [[Sulu Archipelago]]. The submarine approached to within {{convert|700|yd}} of the beach, offloaded supplies &amp; men, picked up a Captain Frank Young, an [[Allied Intelligence Bureau]] coast watcher, and took him to [[Brisbane]].  The operation order also called for ''Seawolf'' to land a party and their supplies on northern [[Palawan (island)|Palawan Island]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.subsowespac.org/the-patrol-zone/special-missions-part-i.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

''Seawolf'' stood out of Brisbane on 21 September to begin her 15th war patrol under the command of [[Lieutenant Commander]] Albert Marion Bontier. She reached [[Manus Island]] on 29 September, refueled, and sailed the same day carrying stores and Army personnel to the east coast of [[Samar (island)|Samar]].

''Seawolf'' and {{USS|Narwhal|SS-167|2}} exchanged [[radar]] recognition signals at 0756 on 3 October in the [[Morotai]] area. Shortly thereafter, a [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]] task group was attacked by {{Ship|Japanese submarine|Ro-41||2}}. {{USS|Shelton|DE-407|2}} was torpedoed and sunk, and {{USS|Richard M. Rowell|DE-403|2}} began to search for the enemy.

Since there were four friendly submarines in the vicinity of this attack, they were directed to give their positions and the other three did, but ''Seawolf'' was not heard from. On 4 October, ''Seawolf'' again was directed to report her position, and again she failed to do so. One of two planes from {{USS|Midway|CVE-63|2}} sighted a submarine submerging and dropped two bombs on it even though it was in a safety zone for American submarines. The site was marked by dye. ''Rowell''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s commanding officer knew he was in a safety lane,&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p.736.&lt;/ref&gt; but, having failed to get word ''Seawolf'' was behind schedule,&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p.736-7.&lt;/ref&gt; believed there was no U.S. submarine nearby and chose to attack. ''Rowell'' established sonar contact on the submarine, which then sent a series of dashes and dots which ''Rowell'' stated bore no resemblance to the existing recognition signals. Believing this an attempt to jam her sonar,&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p.737.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rowell'' attacked with [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehogs]]. The second attack was followed by [[underwater explosion]]s, and debris rose to the surface.

Post-war examination of Japanese records shows no attack listed that could account for the loss of ''Seawolf''. While it is possible ''Seawolf'' was lost to an operational casualty or as a result of an unrecorded enemy attack, it is more likely she was sunk by [[friendly fire]]. 83 officers and men as well as 17 Army passengers were lost. She was the thirty-fourth U.S. submarine lost in the Pacific War, the second (after {{USS|Dorado|SS-248|2}} in the [[Caribbean]]) to friendly fire.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, pp.552fn, 737, 817, &amp; 992.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Army passengers was Captain Howell S. Kopp, an [[Alamo Scouts|Alamo Scout]].  Kopp was en route to an undisclosed location in the Philippines to conduct a clandestine mission in support of the upcoming allied landing on [[Leyte]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alamoscouts.org/photo_archives/320_339.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneternalpatrol.com/kopp-h-s.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 1944, ''Seawolf'' was declared overdue from patrol and presumed lost. She was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 20 January 1945.

==Honors and awards==
''Seawolf'' received 13 [[battle star]]s for [[World War II]] service. She ranked fourteenth in confirmed tonnage sunk (71,609 tons) and tied for seventh in confirmed ships sunk (with {{USS|Rasher|SS-269|2}} and {{USS|Trigger|SS-237|2}}), according to the JANAC accounting postwar.

The contributions and sacrifices of ''Seawolf'' and her crew are officially commemorated in [[Seawolf Park]], located on Pelican Island, just north of Galveston, Texas.

The '''Battle of Los Angeles''', also known as '''The Great Los Angeles Air Raid''', is the name given by contemporary sources to the rumored [[Mainland invasion of the United States|enemy attack]] and subsequent [[anti-aircraft artillery]] barrage which took place from late 24 February to early 25 February 1942 over Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caughy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caughey|first1= John |last2=Caughey|first2=LaRee |title=Los Angeles: biography of a city |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YADTxxBmer8C&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=great+los+angeles+air+raid&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VLDyS4K-OIXGlQeIw-GvDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=great%20los%20angeles%20air%20raid&amp;f=false|year=1977|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03410-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farley&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Farley|first=John E. |title=Earthquake fears, predictions, and preparations in mid-America  |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N_pf4YBuu9wC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22great+los+angeles+air+raid%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s7nyS4CXM8SBlAf9-vjyDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22great%20los%20angeles%20air%20raid%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 May 2010|year=1998|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|isbn=978-0-8093-2201-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident occurred less than three months after the United States entered [[World War II]] as a result of the [[Japanese Imperial Navy]]'s [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack]] on [[Pearl Harbor]], and one day after the [[bombardment of Ellwood]] on 23 February. Initially, the target of the aerial barrage was thought to be an attacking force from [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], but speaking at a press conference shortly afterward, [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Frank Knox]] called the incident a &quot;false alarm.&quot; Newspapers of the time published a number of reports and speculations of a cover-up. 

Some contemporary [[Ufology|ufologists]] and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] have suggested the targets were [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; When documenting the incident in 1949, The United States Coast Artillery Association identified a [[weather balloon|meteorological balloon]] sent up at 1:00 am that &quot;started all the shooting&quot; and concluded that &quot;once the firing started, imagination created all kinds of targets in the sky and everyone joined in&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Col. John G.|title=Activities of The Ninth Army AAA - L.A. &quot;Attacked&quot;|journal=Antiaircraft Journal, The United States Coast Artillery Association|date=May–June 1949|volume=LXXXII|issue=3|page=5|url=http://sill-www.army.mil/ada-online/antiaircraft-journal/_docs/1949/5-6/May-June%201949%20Screen.pdf|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the U.S. Office of Air Force History attributed the event to a case of &quot;war nerves&quot; triggered by a lost weather balloon and exacerbated by stray flares and shell bursts from adjoining batteries.

==Alarms raised==
[[Civil defense siren|Air raid siren]]s sounded throughout Los Angeles County on the night of 24–25 February 1942. A total [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]] was ordered and thousands of [[Air Raid Warden|air raid wardens]] were summoned to their positions. At 3:16&amp;nbsp;am the 37th Coast Artillery Brigade began firing .50 caliber machine guns and 12.8-pound [[anti-aircraft]] shells into the air at reported aircraft; over 1,400 shells would eventually be fired. Pilots of the 4th Interceptor Command were alerted but their aircraft remained grounded. The artillery fire continued sporadically until 4:14&amp;nbsp;am. The &quot;[[all clear]]&quot; was sounded and the blackout order lifted at 7:21&amp;nbsp;am.

Several buildings and vehicles were damaged by shell fragments, and five civilians died as an indirect result of the anti-aircraft fire: three killed in car accidents in the ensuing chaos and two of heart attacks attributed to the stress of the hour-long action.&lt;ref&gt;Niiya, Brian (1993). ''Japanese American History: An A-to-Z Reference from 1868 to the Present''. VNR AG, p. 112.

==Press response==
Within hours of the end of the air raid, Secretary of the Navy [[Frank Knox]] held a press conference, saying the entire incident was a [[false alarm]] due to anxiety and &quot;war nerves.&quot; Knox's comments were followed by statements from the Army the next day&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', 27 February 1942&lt;/ref&gt; that reflected General [[George C. Marshall]]'s belief that the incident might have been caused by commercial airplanes used as a [[psychological warfare]] campaign to generate [[panic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;milmuseum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/BattleofLA.html |title=California in World War II: The Battle of Los Angeles |publisher=Militarymuseum.org |date=25 February 1942 |accessdate=19 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527214255/http://www.militarymuseum.org/BattleofLA.html| archivedate= 27 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary press outlets suspected a cover up. An editorial in the ''[[Long Beach Independent]]'' wrote, &quot;There is a mysterious reticence about the whole affair and it appears that some form of censorship is trying to halt discussion on the matter.&quot; Speculation was rampant as to invading airplanes and their bases. Theories included a secret base in northern [[Mexico]] as well as Japanese [[Submarine aircraft carrier|submarines stationed offshore with the capability of carrying planes]]. Others speculated that the incident was either staged or exaggerated to give coastal defense industries an excuse to move further inland.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', &quot;Information, Please&quot;, 26 Feb. 1942, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative [[Leland M. Ford|Leland Ford]] of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] called for a Congressional investigation, saying, &quot;...none of the explanations so far offered removed the episode from the category of 'complete mystification' ... this was either a practice raid, or a raid to throw a scare into 2,000,000 people, or a mistaken identity raid, or a raid to lay a political foundation to take away Southern California's war industries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', &quot;Knox Assailed on 'False Alarm': West Coast legislators Stirred by Conflicting Air-Raid Statements&quot; 27 Feb. 1942, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the Office of Air Force History concluded that an analysis of the evidence points to meteorological balloons as the cause of the initial alarm:&lt;ref name=&quot;OAFH&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Craven |first1=Wesley Frank |last2=Cate |first2= James Lea |title=The Army Air Forces in World War II: Defense of the Western Hemisphere |url= http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/titleindex.htm |accessdate=18 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325191904/http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/aaf_wwii-v1.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2009 |volume=1 |year=1983 |publisher=Office of Air Force History |location=Washington, D.C |isbn=978-0-912799-03-2 |pages=277–86 |chapter=&quot;West Coast Air Defenses&quot;, &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|During the course of a fireside report to the nation delivered by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] on 23&amp;nbsp;February 1942, a Japanese submarine rose out of the sea off [[Ellwood Oil Field|Ellwood]], a hamlet on the California coast north of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], and pumped thirteen shells into tidewater refinery installations. The shots seemed designed to punctuate the President's statement that &quot;the broad oceans which have been heralded in the past as our protection from attack have become endless battlefields on which we are constantly being challenged by our enemies.&quot; Yet the attack which was supposed to carry the enemy's defiance, and which did succeed in stealing headlines from the President's address, was a feeble gesture rather than a damaging blow. The raider surfaced at 1905 (Pacific time), just five minutes after the President started his speech. For about twenty minutes the submarine kept a position 2,500&amp;nbsp;yards offshore to deliver the shots from its 5½-inch guns. The shells did minor damage to piers and oil wells, but missed the gasoline plant, which appears to have been the aiming point; the military effects of the raid were therefore nil. The first news of the attack led to the dispatch of pursuit planes to the area, and subsequently three bombers joined the attempt to destroy the raider, but without success. The reluctance of AAF commanders to assign larger forces to the task resulted from their belief that such a raid as this would be employed by the enemy to divert attention from a major air task force which would hurl its planes against a really significant target. Loyal Japanese-Americans who had predicted that a demonstration would be made in connection with the President's speech also prophesied that Los&amp;nbsp;Angeles would be attacked the next night. The Army, too, was convinced that some new action impended, and took all possible precautions. Newspapers were permitted to announce that a strict state of readiness against renewed attacks had been imposed, and there followed the confused action known as &quot;The Battle of Los&amp;nbsp;Angeles.&quot;
During the night of 24/25 February 1942, unidentified objects caused a succession of alerts in southern California. On the 24th, a warning issued by naval intelligence indicated that an attack could be expected within the next ten hours. That evening a large number of flares and blinking lights were reported from the vicinity of defense plants. An alert called at 1918 [7:18 pm, Pacific time] was lifted at 2223, and the tension temporarily relaxed. But early in the morning of the 25th renewed activity began. Radars picked up an unidentified target 120&amp;nbsp;miles west of Los Angeles. Antiaircraft batteries were alerted at 0215 and were put on Green Alert—ready to fire—a few minutes later. The AAF kept its pursuit planes on the ground, preferring to await indications of the scale and direction of any attack before committing its limited fighter force. Radars tracked the approaching target to within a few miles of the coast, and at 0221 the regional controller ordered a blackout. Thereafter the information center was flooded with reports of &quot;enemy planes, &quot; even though the mysterious object tracked in from sea seems to have vanished. At 0243, planes were reported near [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], and a few minutes later a coast artillery colonel spotted &quot;about 25&amp;nbsp;planes at 12,000&amp;nbsp;feet&quot; over Los&amp;nbsp;Angeles. At 0306 a balloon carrying a red flare was seen over [[Santa Monica]] and four batteries of [[anti-aircraft artillery]] opened fire, whereupon &quot;the air over Los&amp;nbsp;Angeles erupted like a volcano.&quot; From this point on reports were hopelessly at variance.

Probably much of the confusion came from the fact that anti-aircraft shell bursts, caught by the searchlights, were themselves mistaken for enemy planes. In any case, the next three hours produced some of the most imaginative reporting of the war: &quot;swarms&quot; of planes (or, sometimes, balloons) of all possible sizes, numbering from one to several hundred, traveling at altitudes which ranged from a few thousand feet to more than 20,000 and flying at speeds which were said to have varied from &quot;very slow&quot; to over 200&amp;nbsp;miles per hour, were observed to parade across the skies. These mysterious forces dropped no bombs and, despite the fact that 1,440&amp;nbsp;rounds of anti-aircraft ammunition were directed against them, suffered no losses. There were reports, to be sure, that four enemy planes had been shot down, and one was supposed to have landed in flames at a Hollywood intersection. Residents in a forty-mile arc along the coast watched from hills or rooftops as the play of guns and searchlights provided the first real drama of the war for citizens of the mainland. The dawn, which ended the shooting and the fantasy, also proved that the only damage which resulted to the city was such as had been caused by the excitement (there was at least one death from heart failure), by traffic accidents in the blacked-out streets, or by shell fragments from the artillery barrage.
Attempts to arrive at an explanation of the incident quickly became as involved and mysterious as the &quot;battle&quot; itself. The Navy immediately insisted that there was no evidence of the presence of enemy planes, and [Secretary of the Navy], [[Frank Knox]] announced at a press conference on 25&amp;nbsp;February that the raid was just a false alarm. At the same conference he admitted that attacks were always possible and indicated that vital industries located along the coast ought to be moved inland. The Army had a hard time making up its mind on the cause of the alert. A report to Washington, made by the [[Western Defense Command]] shortly after the raid had ended, indicated that the credibility of reports of an attack had begun to be shaken before the blackout was lifted. This message predicted that developments would prove &quot;that most previous reports had been greatly exaggerated.&quot; The [[Fourth Air Force]] had indicated its belief that there were no planes over Los&amp;nbsp;Angeles. But the Army did not publish these initial conclusions. Instead, it waited a day, until after a thorough examination of witnesses had been finished. On the basis of these hearings, local commanders altered their verdict and indicated a belief that from one to five unidentified airplanes had been over Los&amp;nbsp;Angeles. [[Henry L. Stimson|Secretary Stimson]] announced this conclusion as the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] version of the incident, and he advanced two theories to account for the mysterious craft: either they were commercial planes operated by an enemy from secret fields in California or [[Mexico]], or they were light planes launched from Japanese submarines. In either case, the enemy’s purpose must have been to locate anti-aircraft defenses in the area or to deliver a blow at civilian morale.

The divergence of views between the War and Navy departments, and the unsatisfying conjectures advanced by the Army to explain the affair, touched off a vigorous public discussion. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', in a first-page editorial on 26&amp;nbsp;February, announced that &quot;the considerable public excitement and confusion&quot; caused by the alert, as well as its &quot;spectacular official accompaniments,&quot; demanded a careful explanation. Fears were expressed lest a few phony raids undermine the confidence of civilian volunteers in the aircraft warning service. In the [[United States Congress]], Representative [[Leland Ford]] wanted to know whether the incident was &quot;a practice raid, or a raid to throw a scare into 2,000,000 people, or a mistaken identity raid, or a raid to take away Southern California’s war industries.&quot; [[Wendell Willkie]], speaking in Los&amp;nbsp;Angeles on 26&amp;nbsp;February, assured Californians on the basis of his experiences in England that when a real air raid began &quot;you won’t have to argue about it—you’ll just know.&quot; He conceded that military authorities had been correct in calling a precautionary alert but deplored the lack of agreement between the Army and Navy. A strong editorial in the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' on 27&amp;nbsp;February called the handling of the Los&amp;nbsp;Angeles episode a &quot;recipe for jitters,&quot; and censured the military authorities for what it called &quot;stubborn silence&quot; in the face of widespread uncertainty. The editorial suggested that the Army’s theory that commercial planes might have caused the alert &quot;explains everything except where the planes came from, whither they were going, and why no American planes were sent in pursuit of them.&quot; The ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' on 28&amp;nbsp;February expressed a belief that the more the incident was studied, the more incredible it became: &quot;If the batteries were firing on nothing at all, as Secretary Knox implies, it is a sign of expensive incompetence and jitters. If the batteries were firing on real planes, some of them as low as 9,000&amp;nbsp;feet, as Secretary Stimson declares, why were they completely ineffective? Why did no American planes go up to engage them, or even to identify them? ... What would have happened if this had been a real air raid?&quot; These questions were appropriate, but for the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to have answered them in full frankness would have involved an even more complete revelation of the weakness of our air defenses.

At the end of the war, the Japanese stated that they did not send planes over the area at the time of this alert, although submarine-launched aircraft were subsequently used over [[Seattle]]. A careful study of the evidence suggests that meteorological balloons—known to have been released over Los&amp;nbsp;Angeles—may well have caused the initial alarm. This theory is supported by the fact that anti-aircraft artillery units were officially criticized for having wasted ammunition on targets which moved too slowly to have been airplanes. After the firing started, careful observation was difficult because of drifting smoke from shell bursts. The acting commander of the anti-aircraft artillery brigade in the area testified that he had first been convinced that he had seen fifteen planes in the air, but had quickly decided that he was seeing smoke. Competent correspondents like [[Ernie Pyle]] and [[Bill Henry (Los Angeles Times)|Bill Henry]] witnessed the shooting and wrote that they were never able to make out an airplane. It is hard to see, in any event, what enemy purpose would have been served by an attack in which no bombs were dropped, unless perhaps, as Mr.&amp;nbsp;Stimson suggested, the purpose had been reconnaissance.|''The Army Air Forces in World War II'', prepared under the editorship of [[Wesley Frank Craven]], [[James Lea Cate]]. v.1, pp. 277–86, Washington, D.C. : Office of Air Force History : For sale by the Supt. of Docs., U.S. G.P.O., 1983 [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/I/AAF-I-8.html] }}

==Speculative theories==
===Extraterrestrial hypothesis===
A photo published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on February 26, 1942 has been cited by some ufologists and conspiracy theorists as evidence of an extraterrestrial visitation. They assert that the photo clearly shows [[Searchlight|searchlights]] focused on an alien spaceship; however, the photo was heavily modified by photo retouching prior to publication, a routine practice in graphic arts of the time intended to improve contrast in black and white photos.&lt;ref name=LATimes2&gt;{{cite news|last=Harnisch|first=Larry|title=Another Good Story Ruined: Saucers Over L.A.! – Part 7|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2011/03/another-good-story-ruined-saucers-over-la-part-7.html|accessdate=3 April 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ed Stockly|title=TV Skeptic: 'Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files' looks at the real 'Battle of L.A.'|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/03/tv-skeptic-fact-or-faked-paranormal-files-the-real-battle-of-la.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Los Angeles Times'' writer Larry Harnisch noted that the retouched photo along with faked newspaper headlines were presented as true historical material in trailers for the film ''[[Battle: Los Angeles]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9348">The '''Battle of Barking Creek''' was a [[friendly fire]] incident that happened on 6 September 1939, resulting in the first death of a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[fighter pilot]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]].

==Battle==
At 6.15am on 6 September 1939, unidentified aircraft were reported approaching from the east at high altitude over [[West Mersea]], on the Essex coast.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Yeoman &amp; John Freeborn, ''Tiger Cub – The Story of John Freeborn DFC* A 74 Squadron Fighter Pilot In WWII'', Pen and Sword Aviation, 2009, ISBN 978-1-84884-023-2, p45&lt;/ref&gt; In response, six [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] were ordered to be scrambled from [[No. 56 Squadron RAF|56 Squadron]], based at [[North Weald Airfield]] in Essex.  For some unknown reason, the Squadron’s Commanding Officer, Group Captain Lucking, sent up his entire unit.  In addition to these, and unbeknown to the rest of the pilots, two Pilot Officers took up a pair of reserve aircraft and followed at a distance, destined to be the targets of the mistaken attack.

Additionally, 151 Squadron’s Hurricanes (also from North Weald), and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] from 54, 65, and [[No. 74 Squadron RAF|74]] Squadrons based at [[Hornchurch Airfield]] scrambled. 
With the war only three days old, none of the [[Royal Air Force]] pilots had seen combat, and very few had ever seen a German plane. Communications between planes and command centres were poor. There was no identifying procedure for pilots to distinguish between enemy and friendly aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;cossey&quot;&gt;Bob Cossey, ''A Tiger's Tale: The Story of Battle of Britain Fighter Ace Wg. Cdr. John Connell Freeborn'', ISBN 978-1-900511-64-3, chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

With everyone in the air expecting to see enemy aircraft, and no experience of having done so, the conditions readily lent themselves to misunderstanding. 'A' Flight of 74 Squadron saw what they believed were enemy planes and their commanding officer, [[Adolph Malan|Adolph &quot;Sailor&quot; Malan]], allegedly gave a clear and definite order to engage. Two of the three, Flying Officer Vincent 'Paddy' Byrne and Pilot Officer [[John Freeborn]], opened fire.

Malan later claimed to have given a last minute call of 'friendly aircraft – break away!' but, whether this actually happened or not, the call was not heard by the attacking pilots.&lt;ref name=&quot;cossey&quot;/&gt;

One Hurricane was piloted by Frank Rose, who was shot down but survived. Pilot Officer Montague Hulton-Harrop, however, did not survive. Fired upon by John Freeborn, he was hit in the back of the head; he was dead before his plane crashed at Manor Farm, [[Hintlesham]], Suffolk, approximately five miles west of [[Ipswich]]. He was the first British pilot fatality of the war. His Hurricane was also the first plane shot down by a Spitfire. The entire air-raid warning turned out to be false.

Both Byrne and Freeborn were, along with Group Captain Lucking, placed under close arrest immediately after the incident.

==Aftermath==

===Court martial===
The ensuing [[court martial]] at Fighter Command's [[Bentley Priory]] headquarters was held [[in camera]], and, as of 2010, the papers have not been released.

However, it is well known that Freeborn felt that his commanding Officer, [[Sailor Malan]], tried to evade responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasson&quot;&gt;{{citation| author = Bill Nasson (University of Stellenbosch)| title = A flying Springbok of wartime British skies: A.G. ʻSailorʼ Malan| publisher = ''Kronos, 35: 71–97'', University of Western Cape, South Africa, 2009| url = http://repository.uwc.ac.za/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10566/101/NassonSailor2009.pdf?sequence=1| accessdate = 26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malan testified for the prosecution against his own pilots, stating that Freeborn had been irresponsible, impetuous, and had not taken proper heed of vital communications.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasson&quot;/&gt; During the trial, Freeborn's counsel, [[Patrick Hastings|Sir Patrick Hastings]], called Malan a bare-faced liar.&lt;ref name=&quot;cossey&quot;/&gt; Hastings's deputy in defending the pilots was [[Roger Bushell]], later to be incarcerated with Paddy Byrne at [[Stalag Luft III]] and become the mastermind of the [[Stalag Luft III#The .22Great Escape.22|Great Escape]].

The court completely exonerated both of the Spitfire pilots, ruling the case as an unfortunate accident.

One history summarises it thus: &quot;This tragic shambles, hushed up at the time, was dubbed in the RAF ‘the Battle of Barking Creek’ – a place several miles from the shooting-down but one which, like [[Wigan Pier]], was a standing joke in the music halls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hough, Richard and Denis Richards. ''The Battle of Britain: The Greatest Air Battle of World War II'', WW Norton, 1990, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested by RAF historians that the incident exposed the inadequacies of RAF radar and identification procedures, leading to them being greatly improved by the crucial period of the [[Battle of Britain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;insight&quot;&gt;{{citation | title = Fallen Heroes and the Battle of Barking Creek| publisher = Insight magazine, Issue 6 2009| url = http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafwaddington/rafcms/mediafiles/4A338D24_5056_A318_A8D6E7556D39DEE1.pdf| accessdate = 26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent careers===
Montague Hulton-Harrop is buried with a war grave headstone at St Andrew's Church in [[North Weald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Commonwealth War Graves Commission entry| url = http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=2426950| accessdate = 18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group Captain Lucking was removed from his post as Commanding Officer of 56 Squadron.

Frank Rose was killed in action over [[Vitry-en-Artois]], France, on 18 May 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;insight&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Commonwealth War Graves Commission entry| url = http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=2279942| accessdate = 1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sailor Malan]] went on to be one of the most successful Allied fighter pilots of the war, shooting down 27 Luftwaffe planes and rising to [[Group Captain]]. He received the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and [[Medal bar|bar]] and the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. On his return to South Africa he worked against the [[apartheid]] regime until his death in 1963.

Paddy Byrne was shot down and captured over France in 1940. He was detained at [[Stalag Luft III]] alongside his former defence lawyer [[Roger Bushell]]. In 1944 he was repatriated, having convinced the Germans and the repatriation board that he was mad. On his return to England he was reinstated into the RAF and given a ground position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tamara |last=Miner Haygood (PhD, MD) |title=Malingering and Escape: Anglo-American Prisoners of War in World War II Europe |publisher=War, Literature and The Arts Online |url=http://www.wlajournal.com/webcontent/malingering/malingering.pdf |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Freeborn flew for the rest of the war and proved to be an outstanding airman. He flew more operational hours in the [[Battle of Britain]] than any other pilot. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and bar and rose to [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]]. Freeborn finally told some of his version of events in a 2002 biography called ''A Tiger's Tale'',&lt;ref name=&quot;cossey&quot;/&gt; before co-authoring a more complete account in ''Tiger Cub''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Yeoman &amp; John Freeborn, ''Tiger Cub – The Story of John Freeborn DFC* A 74 Squadron Fighter Pilot In WWII'', Pen and Sword Aviation, 2009, chapter 3. ISBN 978-1-84884-023-2&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 Freeborn told an interviewer of his regret about Hulton-Harrop's death, saying, &quot;I think about him nearly every day. I always have done... I've had a good life, and he should have had a good life too&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Watch: Spitfire pilot John Freeborn's story |publisher=BBC |date=3 September 2009 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theoneshow/onepassions/2009/09/watch-spitfire-pilot-john-free.html |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeborn died on 28 August 2010. He twice married, first in 1941 to Rita Fielder, who died in 1979 and then Peta in 1983, who died in 2001. He was survived by a daughter from his first marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Wing Commander John Freeborn| work = The Daily Telegraph|date=14 September 2010| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/8002880/Wing-Commander-John-Freeborn.html| accessdate = 14 September 2010| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Scylla''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Operazione Scilla'') was a successful [[Italian Royal Navy|Italian Navy]] attempt to transfer the light cruiser ''[[Capitani Romani-class cruiser|Scipione Africano]]'' from their bases in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] to [[Taranto]], in the [[Ionian Sea]], during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943, in the course of [[World War II]]. The operation is notable for the night engagement between the Italian cruiser and four British [[motor torpedo boats]] during the passage of the [[strait of Messina]], in the early hours of 17 July 1943. The action also marked the only time that an Italian warship made an effective combat use of  surface radar in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Warship nº 5|last=Preston|first=Anthony|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=155|quote=&quot;The only ocasion when Italian radar was used effectively by the units was on the night of 17 July 1943, when Scipione Africano encountered four English motor torpedo boats.&quot;|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The mission==
After the Allied landings in Sicily, and in anticipation of an eventual blockade of the strait of Messina by American and British naval forces, the light cruiser ''Scipione Africano'' was ordered to Taranto to supply the lack of fast cruisers in the Ionian Sea. The codename of the mission was &quot;Operation Scylla&quot;.&lt;ref name=and&gt;Andò, Edoardo (1994) ''Incrociatori leggeri classe &quot;Capitani Romani&quot;''. Albertelli, pp. 80-81. ISBN 978-88-85909-45-8 {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian cruiser departed from [[La Spezia]] on 15 July 1943 bound for [[Naples]], which she reached the same evening, shadowed by a British seaplane. At Naples, ''Scipione Africano'' embarked an air liaison team and [[Metox]] equipment. She sailed again at 18:15 on 16 July and entered the Messina straits at 2:00 on 17 July,&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani (1998), p.290&lt;/ref&gt; with a full moon rising from the south.&lt;ref name=mem&gt;[http://ricerca.gelocal.it/iltirreno/archivio/iltirreno/2011/07/23/LXCPO_LXC01.html Ricordi di battaglia e di vita vissuta a bordo di Scipione] by Ludovica Monarca. ''Il Tirreno'', 23 July 2011 {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some days before, on the night of 12 July, British motor torpedo boat MTB 81 had sunk the [[German submarine U-561]] in the northern approaches of the straits.&lt;ref name=sub/&gt;

==Night action==
At the same time she reached the straits, ''Scipione Africano'', which had installed an [[Gufo radar|EC-3 ter Gufo]] [[search radar]],&lt;ref name=mem/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baroni (2007), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; spotted four small vessels lying 10,000 mt ahead, between [[Reggio di Calabria]] and [[Pellaro|Cape Pellaro]], initially misidentified by the Italian commander, captain Ernesto Pellegrini, as friendly [[Marinefährprahm|motor barges]]. A closer look to the maneuvers of the leading vessel at 2:13 convinced Pellegrino that the craft were actually hostile motor torpedo boats, and the captain ordered to increase speed from 24 to 30 knots.&lt;ref name=and/&gt;&lt;ref name=pell&gt;[http://lni.it/portale/notiziario/01_12art9.pdf &quot;Scipione: posto di combattimento&quot;] by Maurizio De Pellegrini Dai Coi {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motor boats were four British  [[PT boat#Elco|Elco]] [[motor torpedo boat]]s from the 10th MTB flotilla based on [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]]: MTB 260, MTB 313, MTB 315 and MTB 316. According to the flotilla's commander, lieutenant Dennis Jermain, who was onboard MTB 315: &quot;I was caught completely napping. We were lying with engines stopped two miles south of Messina, in a flat calm with a full moon silhoutting us nicely. (...) We never dream that a cruiser wil be able to get down there unseen through our patrols.&quot; Jermain gave the alarm and ordered the other boats to start up and scatter.&lt;ref name=dude&gt;[[Dudley Pope|Pope, Dudley]]: ''Flag 4: The Battle of Coastal Forces in the Mediterranean 1939-1945''. Chatham Publishing, 1998, pp. 121-123. ISBN 1-86176-067-1&lt;/ref&gt; Jermain's mission was to intercept Axis landing
craft and [[E-boat]]s.
With no time to make signals, Jermain moved MTB 315 to the east, leaving two boats for each side of the ''Scipione Africano''. Jermain plans were to make a feint with MTB 315 to attract the attention of the cruiser and leave the other boats in a better position for attack.&lt;ref name=dude/&gt;

Meanwhile, captain Pellegrini had turned his ship to 200 degrees, heading to a point between the second and the third motor boats, namely MTB 313 and MTB 316.&lt;ref name=pell/&gt; ''Scipione Africano''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s speed surprised the British,&lt;ref name=&quot;dude&quot; /&gt; who were not fully prepared to fire their torpedoes until the Italian cruiser was just 1,500 yards away. The Italian warship started to fire all her armament in anger, with a precision that, in Pellegrini's own words, &quot;left him amazed&quot;. The Italian report claims that the engagement lasted no more than three minutes, and that the first enemy craft to be hit by 135&amp;nbsp;mm rounds was the closest boat to starboard, which was left in a &quot;sinking condition&quot;.&lt;ref name=pell/&gt;  The British unit was actually MTB 313, only 300 yards away from the Italian warship. The small vessel was ready to launch their torpedoes, when incoming fire injured her commander officer Alec Forster in a leg and mortally wounded the spare officer of the flotilla, sub-lieutenant John McKim. One of the torpedoes passed just ahead of its intended target. After this action, the damaged boat limped away.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The other motor torpedo boat on the cruiser's starboard side was MTB 260, which thought to have scored a torpedo hit on the cruiser.&lt;ref name=&quot;dude&quot; /&gt; After being engaged by gunfire from ''Scipione Africano'',&lt;ref name=&quot;pell&quot; /&gt; MTB 260 got away with minor damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTB&quot; /&gt; The Italian report says that she was set on fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;pell&quot; /&gt;

The next boat to receive the Italian attention was MTB 316, only 50 yards away from ''Scipione Africano''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s port side. The motor torpedo vessel caught fire and blew up just a few seconds after the cruiser's salvos struck home. The craft, commanded by lieutenant Richard Adams and with a crew of eleven, sank with all hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;pell&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naval-history.net/xDKCas1943-07JUL.htm|title=Royal Navy casualties, killed and died, July 1943|website=www.naval-history.net|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion took place so close to the cruiser that pieces from MTB 316's machinery and hull fell aboard ''Scipione Africano''. The analysis of these remains produced some controversy, when Italian sources claimed to have sunk MTB 305, not at the Mediterranean theatre at the time, on the basis of an inscription from a recovered wooden panel.&lt;ref name=&quot;pell&quot; /&gt;

''Scipione Africano'' was checked down the strait by MTB 315 and MTB 260 until she turned to port for Taranto.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The Italian commander reported that one of the craft on the port side sent two torpedoes which were successfully dodged by the Italian unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;pell&quot; /&gt; The British motorboat was in fact MTB 315,&lt;ref name=&quot;dude&quot; /&gt; which became the target of the cruiser's heavy machine guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;pell&quot; /&gt;  During the last phase of the action, the Italian cruiser endured the shelling of German and Italian coastal artillery, which resulted in splinter damage and two seamen injured.&lt;ref name=&quot;pell&quot; /&gt; British sources recorded an air strike on ''Scipione Africano'' by Axis aircraft, not mentioned by Pellegrino's release.&lt;ref name=&quot;dude&quot; /&gt;

==Aftermath==
After her eventful passage into the Ionian Sea, ''Scipione Africano'' reached Taranto the same day at 9:46.&lt;ref name=sub&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani (1998), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; From 4 to 17 August, she laid four minefields in the Gulfs of [[Gulf of Taranto|Taranto]] and [[Gulf of Squillace|Squillace]] along with the old light cruiser ''[[Italian cruiser Luigi Cadorna|Luigi Cadorna]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cocchia, Aldo (1966). ''La Marina italiana nella seconda guerra mondiale: La guerra di mine''. Ufficio Storico della Marina Militare, p. 397 {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the [[Cassibile armistice]] was made public, ''Scipione Africano'' escorted the corvette ''[[Italian corvette Baionetta (F578)|Baionetta]]'' in her task of transporting the new head of government General [[Pietro Badoglio]], his cabinet and the [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Italian Royal Family]] from [[Brindisi]] to [[Malta]]. During the embarkment, she had to fight off a number of hostile aircraft.&lt;ref name=mem/&gt;

The morning after the action, the remains of sub-lieutenant McKim were buried at sea off Augusta. No traces of MTB 316 and her crew were ever found by friendly forces.&lt;ref name=MTB&gt;Reynolds, L. C. and Cooper, h. F. (1999) ''MTBs at War''. Sutton Publishing, pp. 71-72. ISBN 9780750922746&lt;/ref&gt; The following night, another motor torpedo boat, MTB 75, was hit and seriously damaged by shore batteries in the straits of Messina, while on the evening of 19 July, an unidentified U-boat was depth-charged by British small units and had a narrow escape off Reggio di Calabria.&lt;ref name=dude/&gt;

'''USS ''Atlanta'' (CL-51)''' of the [[United States Navy]] was the [[lead ship]] of the {{sclass-|Atlanta|cruiser|0}} of 8 [[light cruiser]]s. She was the third Navy ship named after the city of [[Atlanta]], Georgia. Designed to provide [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] protection for US naval task groups, ''Atlanta'' served in this capacity in the naval battles [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] and the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons|Eastern Solomons]]. ''Atlanta'' was heavily damaged by Japanese and friendly gunfire in a night surface action on 13 November 1942 during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]]. The cruiser was sunk on her captain's orders in the afternoon of the same day.

''Atlanta'', in some works, is designated '''CLAA-51''' because of her primary armament as an Anti-Aircraft cruiser. Hence, all of the ''Atlanta''-class ships are sometimes designated as ''CLAA''. However, her entire battery of {{convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns were dual-purpose (DP) guns, and were capable of being used against both air and surface targets, able to fire anti-aircraft, [[High-explosive shell#High-explosive|high-explosive]] and [[High-explosive shell#Armour-piercing|armor-piercing]] shells. &lt;!--Also, the ''Atlanta'' class was the only class of [[World War II]] American cruisers to be armed with a battery of torpedoes.{{cn|date=October 2015|reason=no citation provided for whole paragraph}} Other classes had torpedoes, may have been the only class built during WWII.--&gt;

The ''Atlanta''-class ships were lightly armored, making them poor surface combatants compared to a typical light cruiser. In terms of armament, the ''Atlanta'' class was closer to a [[destroyer]], being armed with 5&quot; guns, than a light cruiser, which were generally equipped with 6&quot; guns; but at well over 500 feet in length, and combined with their large battery of 16 {{convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns (reduced to 12 in later ships of the class), they were designated as light cruisers. Typical destroyers of the time only carried five or six 5-inch guns. {{citation needed|date=October 2015|reason=no citation provided for whole paragraph}} Despite being under-armored for light cruisers, they had thicker armor than destroyers, which were notoriously underprotected.

==Construction and Commissioning==
The first of the new class of ships was laid down on 22 April 1940 at [[Kearny, New Jersey|Kearny]], [[New Jersey]], by the [[Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co.]], launched on 6 September 1941, sponsored by [[Margaret Mitchell]] (author of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''), and commissioned at the [[New York Navy Yard]] on 24 December 1941, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Samuel P. Jenkins]] in command.&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;{{cite DANFS |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/a/atlanta-cl-51-iii.html |title= Atlanta III (CL-51)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armament===
''Atlanta'' was fitted with eight twin 5-inch gun turrets, placed in a unique configuration. She had three forward turrets and three aft turrets, mounted inline and increasing in height toward the midships, giving her a symmetrical appearance, with a &quot;gap&quot; in the middle superstructure. In addition, the aft battery also had one &quot;wing-mounted&quot; turret on each side, for a total of 16 five-inch guns. The firing arcs of the forward and aft batteries intersected at a very limited angle, giving her an arc of 60° in which she could fire all of her guns broadside (excluding the wing turrets). Because ''Atlanta'' was able to bring all her guns to bear only within that narrow arc, her ability to engage surface targets was limited. Her firing arcs were ideally suited to bringing her guns to bear on an aircraft, however, with a minimum of six guns available from any angle.{{citation needed|date=October 2015|reason=no citation provided for whole paragraph}}

==Service history==
After fitting out, ''Atlanta'' conducted shakedown training until 13 March, first in [[Chesapeake Bay]] and then in [[Maine]]'s [[Casco Bay]], after which she returned to the New York Navy Yard for post-shakedown repairs and alterations. Adjudged to be &quot;ready for distant service&quot; on 31 March, the new cruiser departed New York for the [[Panama Canal Zone]] on 5 April. She reached [[Cristóbal, Panama|Cristobal]] on the 8th. After transiting the isthmian waterway, ''Atlanta'' then cleared [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]] on 12 April with orders to reconnoiter [[Clipperton Island]], a tiny barren, uninhabited atoll about 670&amp;nbsp;mi (1,080&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of [[Acapulco]], [[Mexico]], in the course of her voyage to the [[Hawaiian Islands]], for any signs of enemy activity. Finding none, she ultimately reached [[Pearl Harbor]] on 23 April.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

===Battle of Midway===
[[File:USS Hornet USS Atlanta USS New Orleans 1942.jpg|thumb|left|''Atlanta'' with {{USS|Hornet|CV-8}} and {{USS|New Orleans|CA-32}}, 6 June 1942.]]
Punctuating her brief stay in Hawaiian waters with an antiaircraft practice off [[Oahu]] on 3 May, ''Atlanta'', in company with {{USS|McCall|DD-400|2}}, sailed on 10 May as escort for {{USS|Rainier|AE-5|2}} and {{USS|Kaskaskia|AO-27|2}}, bound for [[Nouméa]], [[New Caledonia]]. On 16 May, she joined [[Vice Admiral]] [[William F. Halsey]]'s [[Task Force 16]] (TF 16), formed around {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}} and {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}}, as it steamed back to Pearl Harbor, having been summoned back to Hawaiian waters in response to an imminent [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] thrust in the direction of [[Midway Atoll]]. TF 16 arrived at Pearl on 26 May.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

''Atlanta'' again sailed with TF 16 on the morning of the 28th. Over the days that followed, she screened the carriers as they operated northeast of Midway in anticipation of the enemy's arrival. At the report of Japanese ships to the southwest, on the morning of 4 June, ''Atlanta'' cleared for action as she screened ''Hornet''. Squadrons from the American carriers sought out the Japanese, and during that day, planes from {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}} and ''Enterprise'' inflicted mortal damage on four irreplaceable enemy flattops. Japanese planes twice hit [[Task Force 17|TF 17]], and it took the brunt of the enemy attacks. Over the days that followed the [[Battle of Midway]], ''Atlanta'' remained in the screen of TF 16 until 11 June, when the task force received orders to return to Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Reaching her destination on 13 June, ''Atlanta'', outside brief periods of antiaircraft practice on 21 and 25–26 June, remained in port, taking on stores and provisions and standing on 24-hour and then 48-hour alert into July 1942. [[Drydock]]ed on 1–2 July so that her bottom could be scraped, cleaned and painted, the cruiser completed her availability on the 6th and then resumed a busy schedule of gunnery practice with drone targets, high-speed sleds, and in shore bombardment in the Hawaiian operating area.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

On 15 July 1942, ''Atlanta'', again in TF 16, sailed for [[Tongatapu]]. Anchoring at [[Nukuʻalofa]], [[Tonga]] on 24 July, where she fueled {{USS|Maury|DD-401|2}} and then took on fuel from ''Mobilube'', the light cruiser pushed on later the same day and overtook TF 16. On 29 July, as all preparations proceeded for the invasion of [[Guadalcanal]], ''Atlanta'' was assigned to TF 61.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Screening the carriers as they launched air strikes to support the initial landings on 7–8 August, ''Atlanta'' remained there until the withdrawal of the carrier task forces on the 9th. For the next several days, she remained at sea, replenishing when necessary while the task force operated near the Solomons.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

===Battle of the Eastern Solomons===
{{further|Battle of the Eastern Solomons}}

As the Americans consolidated their gains on Guadalcanal, the critical need for reinforcements prompted Japanese Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] to send the [[Combined Fleet]] south to cover a large troop convoy. American scout planes spotted the Japanese forces on the morning of 23 August. With the enemy reported to the northwest, ''Enterprise'' and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} launched search and attack planes, but they failed to make contact because of deteriorating weather and the fact that the Japanese, knowing that they had been spotted, reversed course.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Throughout the day on 24 August, ''Atlanta'' received enemy contact reports and screened ''Enterprise'' as she launched a strike group to attack the Japanese carriers. The sighting of an enemy &quot;snooper&quot; at 1328 sent ''Atlanta''{{'}}s sailors to general quarters, where they remained for the next 5½ hours. At 1530, the cruiser worked up to {{convert|20|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} as TF 16 stood roughly north-northwestward &quot;to close [the] reported enemy carrier group.&quot; At 1637, with unidentified planes approaching, ''Atlanta'' went to {{convert|25|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Enterprise'' then launched a strike group shortly thereafter, completing the evolution at 1706.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

In the meantime, the incoming enemy bombers and [[fighter aircraft]] from {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shōkaku||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}} prompted the task force to increase speed to {{convert|27|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}, shortly after ''Enterprise'' completed launching her own aircraft, the Japanese raid, estimated by Captain Jenkins to consist of at least 18 [[Aichi D3A]]1 &quot;Val&quot; [[dive bomber]]s, came in from the north northwest at 1710. Over the next 11 minutes, ''Atlanta''{{'}}s  [[5&quot;/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}}]], [[1.1&quot;/75 caliber gun|{{convert|1.1|in|mm|abbr=on}}]] and [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20 mm]] batteries contributed to the barrage over ''Enterprise'', as the light cruiser conformed to ''Enterprise''{{'}}s every move as she maneuvered violently to avoid the dive bombers.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Despite the heavy antiaircraft fire, ''Enterprise'' took one hit and suffered some shrapnel damage from an estimated five near hits. Captain Jenkins later reported that his ship may have shot down five of the attackers.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; ''Atlanta'' was not damaged in the engagement.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Reporting to [[Task Force 11|TF 11]] for duty the following day, ''Atlanta'' operated with that force, redesignated TF 61 on 30 August, over the next few days. When {{Ship|Japanese submarine|I-26||2}} torpedoed ''Saratoga'' on 31 August, the light cruiser screened the stricken [[flagship]] as {{USS|Minneapolis|CA-36|2}} rigged a towline and began taking her out of danger. The force ultimately put into Tongatapu on 6 September, where ''Atlanta'' provisioned ship, fueled from {{USS|New Orleans|CA-32|2}}, and enjoyed a period of upkeep.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Underway on 13 September, the light cruiser escorted {{USS|Lassen|AE-3|2}} and {{USS|Hammondsport|APV-2|2}} on the 15th. After seeing her charges safely to their destination at [[Dumbea Bay]], Nouméa, on the 19th, ''Atlanta'' fueled, took on stores and ammunition, and sailed on the 21st as part of Task Group 66.4 (TG 66.4). Becoming part of TF 17 on 23 September, the light cruiser was detached the following day to proceed in company with {{USS|Washington|BB-56|2}}, {{USS|Walke|DD-416|2}} and {{USS|Benham|DD-397|2}} to Tongatapu, which she reached on the 26th.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Underway with those same ships on 7 October, ''Atlanta'' briefly escorted Guadalcanal-bound transports from 11–14 October, before putting into [[Espiritu Santo]] for fuel on the afternoon of the 15th. Assigned then to [[Rear Admiral]] [[Willis A. Lee]]'s TF 64, the ship sailed after dark that same day to resume operations covering the ongoing efforts to secure Guadalcanal. Returning briefly to Espiritu Santo for fuel, stores and provisions, the warship stood out from Segond Channel on the afternoon of 23 October.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Two days later, with a [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] offensive having failed to eject the Americans from Guadalcanal, Admiral Yamamoto sent the Combined Fleet south in an attempt to annihilate the American naval forces doggedly supporting the marines. ''Atlanta'' operated in TF 64, along with ''Washington'', {{USS|San Francisco|CA-38|2}}, {{USS|Helena|CL-50|2}} and two destroyers, as the opposing forces engaged in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] on 26 October. That day, ''Atlanta'' patrolled astern of the fueling group supporting the two American carrier task forces. On the 27th, when {{Ship|Japanese submarine|I-15||2}} attacked TF 64, the force maneuvered at high speed to clear the area.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

On the morning of the 28th, ''Atlanta'' brought on board Rear Admiral [[Norman Scott (admiral)|Norman Scott]] from ''San Francisco'', and became the flagship of the newly designated TG 64.2. After fueling from ''Washington'', ''Atlanta'', screened by four destroyers, headed northwest to shell Japanese positions on Guadalcanal. Reaching the waters off [[Lunga Point]] on the morning of the 30th, ''Atlanta'' embarked [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] liaison officers at 0550, and then steamed west, commencing her bombardment of [[Point Cruz]] at 0629 while the destroyers formed a column astern. Provoking no return fire, TG 64.2 accomplished its mission and returned to Lunga Point, where ''Atlanta'' disembarked the liaison officers. She then proceeded, in company with her screen, to Espiritu Santo, where she arrived on the afternoon of 31 October.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

====Convoy Escort====
[[File:USS Atlanta (CL-51) broadside view 1942.jpg|thumb|''Atlanta'' on 25 October 1942.]]
''Atlanta'' served as Admiral Scott's flagship as the light cruiser, accompanied by four destroyers, escorted {{USS|Zeilin|AP-9|2}}, {{USS|Libra|AK-53|2}} and {{USS|Betelgeuse|AK-28|2}} to Guadalcanal. The cruiser and her consorts continued to screen those ships, designated TG 62.4, as they lay off Lunga Point on 12 November unloading supplies and disembarking troops.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

At 0905, the task group received a report that nine bombers and 12 fighters were approaching from the northwest, and would reach their vicinity at about 0930. At about 0920, ''Atlanta'' led the three auxiliaries to the north in column, with the destroyers spaced in a circle around them. 15 minutes later, nine &quot;Vals&quot; from {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiyō||2}} emerged from the clouds over [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]], the American airstrip on Guadalcanal. The American ships opened fire soon after, putting up a barrage that downed &quot;several&quot; planes. Fortunately, none of the primary targets of the attack, ''Zeilin'', ''Libra'' and ''Betelgeuse'', suffered more than minor damage from several close calls, though ''Zeilin'' sustained some flooding. The three auxiliaries returned to the waters off Lunga Point as soon as the attack ended and resumed working cargo and disembarking troops.

A little over an hour later, at 1050, ''Atlanta'' received word of another incoming Japanese air raid. 15 minutes later, ''Atlanta'' led the three auxiliaries north with the destroyers in a circle around the disposition. The &quot;[[Brevity code#B|bogeys]]&quot;, 27 [[Mitsubishi G4M]] &quot;Bettys&quot; from [[Rabaul]], closed, sighted bearing west by north, approaching from over [[Cape Esperance]] in a very loose &quot;V&quot; formation. Although the destroyers opened fire, the planes proved to be out of range and the ships checked fire. The &quot;Bettys&quot;, for their part, ignored the ships and continued on to bomb Henderson Field. Upon the disappearance of the planes, TG 62.4 resumed unloading off Lunga Point.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

On 12 November, ''Atlanta'' was still off Lunga Point, screening the unloading, as part of TF 67 under Rear Admiral [[Daniel J. Callaghan]] in ''San Francisco''. At about 1310, ''Atlanta'' received a warning that 25 enemy planes were headed for Guadalcanal, slated to arrive within 50 minutes. The light cruiser went to general quarters at 1318 and received the signal &quot;prepare to repel air attack....&quot;&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Within six minutes, ''Atlanta'' and the other combatants of the support group formed a screen around the transport group (TG 67.1), and the two groups steamed north together at {{convert|15|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. At about 1410, the Americans sighted the incoming raid, consisting of what appeared to be 25 twin-engined bombers (&quot;Bettys&quot;) which broke up into two groups after clearing Florida Island, came in at altitudes that ranged from 25 to 50&amp;nbsp;ft (8 to 16m). {{USS|Juneau|CL-52|2}} opened fire at 1412. ''Atlanta'' did so a minute later, training her guns at planes headed for the gap in the screen between ''San Francisco'' and {{USS|Buchanan|DD-484|2}}. ''Atlanta'' claimed to have shot down two &quot;Bettys&quot;, just after they dropped their torpedoes, at about 1415, only three minutes before the attack ended. Once the last Japanese plane had been splashed, the work of unloading the transports and cargo ships resumed. One &quot;Betty&quot;, crippled by antiaircraft fire, crashed into the after superstructure of ''San Francisco'', inflicting the only damage on the force.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

====Night Attack====
The abrupt end of the air attack gave ''Atlanta'' and her colleagues only a brief respite, however, for trouble approached from yet another quarter. A Japanese surface force, made up of two battleships, one cruiser and six destroyers, was detected steaming south toward Guadalcanal to shell Henderson Field. Admiral Callaghan's support group was to &quot;cover [the retiring transports and cargo vessels] against enemy attack.&quot; TG 67.4 departed Lunga Point about 1800 and steamed eastward through [[Sealark Channel]], covering the withdrawal of TG 67.1. An hour before midnight, Callaghan's ships reversed course and headed westward.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

''Helena''{{'}}s radar picked up the first contact at a range of {{convert|26,000|yd|nmi|abbr=on}}. As the range closed, ''Atlanta''{{'}}s surface search radar, followed by her gunnery radars, picked up a contact on the enemy ships.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Admiral Callaghan's order for a course change caused problems almost at once, as ''Atlanta'' had to turn to port (left) immediately to avoid a collision with one of the four destroyers in the van, the latter having apparently executed a &quot;ships left&quot; rather than &quot;column left&quot; movement.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; As ''Atlanta'' began moving to resume her station ahead of ''San Francisco'', the {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Akatsuki|1932|2}} illuminated the light cruiser; and immediately suffered the consequences. ''Atlanta'' shifted her main battery to fire at the enemy destroyer, opening fire at a range of about 1,600 yd (1,500 m) and, along with other US ships that concentrated on ''Akatsuki''’s searchlights, simply overwhelmed the hapless destroyer.&lt;ref&gt;The Lost Ships of Guadalcanal by Robert Ballard and The Naval Battle of Guadalcanal: Night Action 13 November 1942 by James Grace&lt;/ref&gt;

As two other Japanese destroyers crossed her line, ''Atlanta'' engaged both with her forward 5 in (127 mm) mounts, while her after mounts continued to blast away at the illuminated ship. An additional, unidentified assailant also opened up on the light cruiser from the northeast.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; At about that time, at least one torpedo plowed into ''Atlanta's'' forward engine room from the port side, fired almost certainly by either {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Inazuma|1932|2}} or {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Ikazuchi|1931|2}}&lt;ref&gt;Entry for 12–13 November: First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on both http://www.combinedfleet.com/ikazuc_t.htm '''AND''' http://www.combinedfleet.com/inazum_t.htm&lt;/ref&gt; (''Akatsuki''’s destroyer consorts). ''Atlanta'' lost all but auxiliary diesel power, suffered the interruption of her gunfire, and had to shift steering control to the steering engine room aft. Meanwhile ''Akatsuki'' drifted out of the action and soon sank with heavy loss of life. Michiharu Shinya, ''Akatsuki'''s Chief Torpedo Officer, one of her few survivors, was rescued the next day by US Forces and spent the rest of the war in a New Zealand Prisoner Of War camp.&lt;ref&gt;The Path From Guadalcanal by Michiharu Shinya and The Lost Ships of Guadalcanal by Robert Ballard&lt;/ref&gt; (He latter stated unequivocally that ''Akatsuki'' had ''not'' been able to fire ''any'' torpedoes that night before being overwhelmed by gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;Editors Note 1 http://www.combinedfleet.com/akatsu_t.htm&lt;/ref&gt;)

Soon after being torpedoed, ''Atlanta'' was then hit by an estimated nineteen 8-inch (203 mm) shells when ''San Francisco'', &quot;in the urgency of battle, darkness, and confused intermingling of friend or foe&quot;, fired into her. Though almost all of the shells passed through the thin skin of the ship without detonating, scattering green dye, fragments from their impact killed many men, including Admiral Scott and members of his staff. ''Atlanta'' prepared to return fire on her new assailant, but ''San Francisco's'' own gun flashes disclosed a distinctly &quot;non-Japanese hull profile&quot; that resulted in a suspension of those efforts.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt; ''San Francisco's'' shells, which passed high through ''Atlanta's'' superstructure, may have been intended for a Japanese target further beyond her from ''San Francisco's'' perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison Vol 5 XII.4.b note 22&lt;/ref&gt;

After the {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on}} fire ceased, ''Atlanta''{{'}}s Captain Jenkins took stock of the situation, and, having only a minor foot wound, made his way aft to Battle II. His ship was badly battered, largely powerless, down by the head and listing slightly to port, and a third of his crew was dead or missing. As the battle continued, the light cruiser's men began clearing debris, jettisoning topside weight to correct the list, reducing the volume of sea water in the ship, and succoring the many wounded.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

====Sinking====
Daylight revealed the presence nearby of three burning American destroyers, the disabled ''Portland'', and the abandoned hulk of {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Yūdachi|1936|2}}, which ''Portland'' summarily dispatched with three salvoes. ''Atlanta'', drifting toward the enemy-held shore east of Cape Esperance, dropped her starboard anchor, and her captain sent a message to ''Portland'' explaining the light cruiser's condition. Boats from Guadalcanal came out to take her most critically wounded. By mid-morning, all of those had been taken off the ship.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

{{USS|Bobolink|AM-20|2}} arrived at 0930 on 13 November, took ''Atlanta'' under tow, made harder by the cruiser's still lowered anchor, and headed toward Lunga Point. During the voyage, a [[Mitsubishi G4M|&quot;Betty&quot; bomber]] neared the disposition, and one of the two surviving {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} mounts, the one powered by a diesel generator, fired and drove it off. The other mount, on manual control, could not be trained around in time.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

''Atlanta'' reached Kukum about 1400, at which point Captain Jenkins conferred with his remaining officers. As Jenkins, who was later awarded a [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] for his heroism during the battle, later wrote, &quot;It was by now apparent that efforts to save the ship were useless, and that the water was gaining steadily.&quot; Even had sufficient salvage facilities been available, he allowed, the severe damage she had taken would have made it difficult to save the ship. Authorized by Commander, South Pacific Forces, to act at his own discretion regarding the destruction of the ship, Jenkins ordered that ''Atlanta'' be abandoned and sunk with a demolition charge.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

Accordingly, all remaining men except the captain and a demolition party boarded [[Higgins boat]]s sent out from Guadalcanal for the purpose. After the charge had been set and exploded, the last men left the battered ship. Ultimately, at 2015 on 13 November 1942, ''Atlanta'' sank 3&amp;nbsp;mi (5&amp;nbsp;km) west of Lunga Point in about 400&amp;nbsp;ft (120&amp;nbsp;m) of water. Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 13 January 1943.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;

====Exploration of the Wreck====
The wreck of the ''USS Atlanta'' was discovered in 1992 by an expedition led by Dr [[Robert Ballard]] using a [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]], (ROV). Dr Ballard was famous for leading the expeditions that discovered the ''[[RMS Titanic]]'' and the [[German battleship Bismarck|''DKM Bismarck'']]. Unfortunately, strong ocean currents and poor visibility prevented the expedition from thoroughly exploring the ''Atlanta''. In 1994, two Australian [[Technical diving|technical divers]] Rob Cason and Kevin Denlay travelled to Solomon Islands with the intention of being the first scuba divers to dive the ''Atlanta'' but this was unsuccessful because of the lack of a suitable surface support vessel and strong surface currents; this was also the first mixed gas scuba diving expedition to Guadalcanal.  However, they did manage to dive one of the two other, deepest diveable wrecks; the Japanese transport ''[[Azumasan Maru]]'', which is almost 90m deep at the stern and the ''Sasako Maru'', which Denlay dived in 1995 at over 90m in the collapsed debris field of the bridge. Many other World War II wrecks discovered by Dr Ballard in Iron Bottom Sound are beyond the current technical limit for scuba and are only accessible by ROVs or submersibles. Dr Ballard gives an account of this in his book  ''The Lost Ships of Guadalcanal''. In the same year, Denlay returned with American Terrance Tysall and made the first successful scuba dive on the ''USS Atlanta'', which was at the time the deepest wreck dive by free swimming divers in the southern hemisphere.{{citation needed|date=October 2015|reason=no citation provided for whole paragraph}}

In the following years, Denlay and Tysall mounted several larger expeditions to survey the ''Atlanta'', exploring and videoing the wreck in detail to a depth of 130&amp;nbsp;m (430&amp;nbsp;ft) at the bow.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advanceddivermagazine.com/ezinefreearticles/Guadalcanal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The civil unrest in Solomon Islands from late 1998 prevented further diving around Guadalcanal for a couple of years. However, on the final expedition that year, the then deepest wreck dive by a woman was made by Kevin’s wife, Mirja, on the ''Atlanta''. Denlay's last visit to the wreck was in 2002 using a [[Rebreather|closed circuit rebreather]] or CCR, the first CCR dive on the ''Atlanta''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.divenewzealand.com/index.asp?s1=dive-articles&amp;id=106&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, very few dives have been conducted on the ''Atlanta'', although in May 2011 a very experienced deep diving team from ''Global Underwater Explorers'' successfully videoed the wreck for documentary purposes, the first survey of the wreck since Denlay’s expeditions up to 1998.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Awards==
''Atlanta'' was awarded five battle stars for her World War II service and a [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] for her &quot;heroic example of invincible fighting spirit&quot; in the battle off Guadalcanal on 13 November 1942.&lt;ref name=DANFS /&gt;
